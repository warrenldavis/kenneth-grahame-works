EDITOR’S NOTE 

The purpose of this series is to reproduce some of the 
best contemporary and recent literature in a form and at 
a price suitable for educational purposes. 

The stories in the present volume are taken from “ THE 
GOLDEN AGE ” and “ DREAM DAYS.” Though none 
has been abridged, a few have been excluded. Teachers 
in the past have found that the rather " Olympian ” and 
retrospective atmosphere of some is beyond the under- 
standing of children. Only those that seem to the editor 
to answer to this description have been left out.

A HOLIDAY 


T he masterful wind wras up and out, shoudng and 
chasing, the lord of the morning. Poplars swayed 
and tossed with a roaring swish ; dead leaves sprang aloft, 
and whirled into space ; and all the clear-swept heaven 
seemed to thrill with sound like a great harp. It was one 
of the first awakenings of the year. The earth stretched 
herself, smiling in her sleep ; and everything leapt and 
pulsed to the stir of the giant’s movement. With us it 
was a whole hohday ; the occasion a birthday — it matters 
not whose. Some one of us had had presents, and pretty 
conventional speeches, and had glowed with that sense of 
heroism which is no less sweet that nothing has been done 
to deserve it. But the holiday was for all, the rapture of 
awakening Nature for aU, the various outdoor joys of 
puddles and sun and hedge-breaking for all. Colt-like I 
ran through the meadows, frisking happy heels in the face 
of Nature laughing responsive. Above, the sky was bluest 
of the blue ; wide pools left by the winter’s floods Hashed 
the colour back, true and brilliant ; and the soft air thrilled 
with the germinating touch that seems to kindle something 
in my own small person as well as in the rash primrose 
already lurking in sheltered haunts. Out into the brim- 
ming sun-bathed world I sped, free of lessons, free of 
discipline and correction, for one day at least. My legs 
ran of themselves, and though 1 heard my name called 
faint and shrill behind, there was no stopping for me. It was 
only Harold, I concluded, and his legs, though shorter 
than mine, were good for a longer spurt than this. Then I 
heard it called again, but this time more faintly, with a 
pathetic break in the middle ; and I pulled up short, 
recognizing Charlotte’s plaintive note.

3 A HOLIDAY 

She panted up anon, and dropped on the turf beside me*. 
Neither had any desire for talk ; the glow and the glory of 
existing on this perfect morning were satisfaction full and 
sufficient. 

“ Where’s Harold ? ” I asked presently. 

“ Oh, he’s just playin’ muffin-man, as usual,” said 
Charlotte with petulance. “ Fancy wanting to be a 
muffin-man on a whole holiday ! ” 

It was a strange craze, certainly ; but Harold, who 
invented his own games and played them without assistance, 
always stuck staunchly to a new fad, till he had worn it 
quite out. Just at present he was a muffin-man, and day 
and night he went through passages and up and down 
staircases, ringing a noiseless bell and offering phantom 
muffins to invisible wayfarers. It sounds a poor sort of 
sport ; and yet — to pass along busy streets of your own 
building, for ever ringing an imaginary bell and offering 
airy muffins of your own make to a bustling thronging 
crowd of your own creation — ^there were points about the 
game, it cannot be denied, though it seemed scarce in 
harmony with this radiant wind-swept morning ! 

“ And Edward, where is he ? ” I questioned again. 

“ He’s coming along by the road,” said Charlotte. 
” He’ll be crouching in the ditch when we get there, and 
he’s going to be a grizzly bear and spring out on us, only 
you mustn’t say I told you, ’cos it’s to be a surprise.” 

” All right,” I said magnanimously. ” Come on and 
let’s be surprised.” But I could not help feeling that on this 
day of days even a grizzly felt misplaced and common. 

Sure enough an undeniable bear sprang out on us as 
we dropped into the road ; then ensued shrieks, growlings, 
revolver-shots, and unrecorded heroisms, till Edward 
condescended at last to roll over and die, bulking large and 
grim, an unmitigated grizzly. It was an understood thing, 
that whoever took upon himself to be a bear must eventually 
die, sooner or later, even if he were the eldest bom ; else, 
life would have been all strife and carnage, and the Age 
of Acorns have displaced our hard-won civilization. Tffis 



A HOLIDAY 3 

kittle aiTair concluded with satisfaction to all parties con- 
cerned, we rambled along the road, picking up the default- 
ing Harold by the way, muffinless now and in his right and 
social mind. 

“ What would you do ? ” asked Charlotte presently — 
the book of the moment always dominating her thoughts 
until it was sucked dry and cast aside, — “ What would you 
do if you saw two lions in the road, one on each side, and 
you didn’t know if they was loose or if they was chained 
up ? ” 

“ Do ? ” shouted Edward valiantly, “ I should — I should 

— I should ” His boastful accents died away into a 

mumble . “ Dunno what I should do.” 

“ Shouldn’t do anything,” I observed after considera- 
tion ; and, really, it would be difficult to arrive at a wiser 
conclusion. 

” If it came to doing," remarked Harold reflectively, 
“ the lions would do all the doing there was to do, wouldn’t 
they ? ” 

“ But if they was good lions” rejoined Charlotte, ” they 
would do as they would be done by.” 

“ Ah, but how are you to know a good lion from a bad 
one ? ” said Edward. “ The books don’t tell you at all, 
and the lions ain’t marked any different.” 

“ Why, there aren’t any good lions,” said Harold hastily 

“ O yes, there are, heaps and heaps,” contradicted 
Edward. “ Nearly all the lions in the story-books are good 
lions. There was Androdes’ lion, and St. Jerome’s lion, 
and — and — and the Lion and the Unicom ” 

“ He beat the Unicorn,” observed Harold dubiously, 
“ all round the town,” 

“ That proves he was a good lion,” cried Edward 
triumphantly. “ But the question is, how arc you to tell 
’em when you sec ’em ? ” 

“ / should ask Martha,” said Harold of the simple creed. 

Edward snorted contemptuously, then turned to Char- 
lotte. “ Look here,” he said ; “ let’s play at lions, anyhow, 
and I’ll run on to that corner and be a lion, — I’ll be two 



4 A HOLIDAY 

lions, one on each side of the road, — and you’ll come along^ 
and you won’t know whether I’m chained up or not, and 
that’ll be the fun ! ” 

“ No, thank you,” said Charlotte firmly ; “ you’ll be 
chained up till I’m quite close to you and then you’ll be 
loose, and you’ll tear me in pieces, and make my frock all 
dirty, and p’raps you’ll hurt me as well. / know your 
lions ! ” 

“ No, I won’t, I swear I won’t,” protested Edward. 
“ I’ll be quite a new hon this time — something you can’t 
imagine.” And he raced off to his post. Charlotte 
hesitated — then she went timidly on, at each step growing 
less Charlotte, the mummer of a minute and more the 
anxious Pilgrim of all time. The lion’s wrath waxed terrible 
at her approach ; his roaring filled the startled air. I 
waited until they were both thoroughly absorbed, and then 
I slipped through the hedge out of the tiodden highway, 
into the vacant meadow spaces. It was not that I was 
unsociable, nor that I knew Edward’s lions to the point of 
satiety ; but the passion and the call of the divine morning 
were high in my blood Earth to earth ! That was the 
frank note, the joyous summons of the day ; and they 
could not but jar and seem artificial, these human discus- 
sions and pretences, when boon nature, reticent no more, 
was singing that full-throated song of hers that thrills and 
claims control of every fibre. The air was wine, the moist 
earth-smell wine, the lark’s song, the wafts from the cow- 
shed at top of the field, the pant and smoke of a distant 
train — all were wine — or song, was it ? or odour, this unity 
they all blent into ? I had no words then to describe it, 
that earth-effluence of which I was so conscious ; nor, 
indeed, have I found words since. I ran sideways, shout- 
ing ; I dug glad heels into the squelching soil ; I splashed 
diamond showers from puddles with a stick ; I hurled 
clods skyward at random, and presently I somehow found 
myself singing. The words were mere nonsense — ^irre- 
sponsible babble ; the tune was an improvisation, a weary, 
unrhythmic thing of rise and fall : and yet it seemed to me 



A HOLIDAY 


5 

a genuine utterance, and just at that moment the one thing 
fitting and right and perfect. Humanity would have 
rejected it with scorn. Nature, everywhere singing in the 
same key, recognized and accepted it without a flicker of 
dissent. 

All the time the hearty wind was calling to me com- 
panionably from where he swung and bellowed in the 
tree-tops. “ Take me for guide to-day,” he seemed to 
plead. “ Other holidays you have tramped it in the track 
of the stolid, unswerving sun ; a belated truant, you have 
dragged a weary foot homeward with only a pale, expres- 
sionless moon for company To-day why not I, the 
trickster, the hypocrite ^ I who whip round comers and 
bluster, relapse and evade, then rally and pursue ! I can 
lead you the best and rarest dance of any ; for I am the 
strong capricious one, the lord of misrule, and I alone 
am irresponsible and unprincipled, and obey no law.” And 
for me, I was ready enough to fall in with the fellow’s 
humour ; was not this a whole holiday ? So we sheered off 
together, arm-in-arm, so to speak ; and with fullest con- 
fidence I took the jigging, thwartwise course my chainless 
pilot laid for me. v 

A whimsical comrade I found him, ere he had done with 
me. Was it in jest, or with some serious purpose of his own, 
that he brought me plump upon a pair of lovers, silent, face 
to face o’er a discreet unwinking stile ? As a rule this sort 
of thing struck me as the most pitiful tomfoolery. Two 
calves rubbing noses through a gate were natural and right 
and within the order of things ; but that human beings, 
with salient interests and active pursuits beckoning them 
on from every side, could thus — ! Well, it was a thing to 
hurry past, shamed of face, and think on no more. But 
this morning everything I met seemed to be accounted for 
and set in tune by that same magical touch in the air ; and 
it was with a certain surprise that I found myself regarding 
these fatuous ones with kindliness instead of contempt, as 
I rambled by, unheeded of them. There was indeed some 
reconciling influence abroad, which could bring the like 



6 A HOLIDAY 

antics into harmony with bud and growth and the frolic 
air. 

A puff on the right cheek from my wilful companion sent 
me off at a fresh angle, and presently I came in sight of the 
village church, sitting solitary within its circle of elms. 
From forth the vestry window projected two small legs, 
gyrating, hungry for foothold, with larceny — not to say 
sacrilege — ^in their every wriggle : a godless sight for a 
supporter of the Establishment. Though the rest was 
hidden, I knew the legs well enough ; they were usually 
attached to the body of Bill Saunders, the peerless bad boy 
of the village. Bill’s coveted booty, too, I could easily 
guess at that ; it came from the Vicar’s store of biscuits, 
kept (as I knew) in a cupboard along with his ofGcial 
trappings. For a moment I hesitated ; then I passed on my 
way. I protest I was not on Bill’s side ; but then, neither 
was I on the Vicar’s, and there was something in this 
immoral morning which seemed to say that perhaps, after 
all. Bill had as much right to the biscuits as the Vicar, and 
would certainly enjoy them better ; and anyhow it was a 
disputable point, and no business of mine. Nature, who 
had accepted me for ally, cared little who had the world’s 
biscuits, and assuredly was not going to let any friend of 
hers waste his time in playing policeman for Society. 

He was tugging at me anew, my insistent guide ; and 
I felt sure, as I rambled off in his wake, that he had more 
holiday matter to show me. And so, indeed, he had ; and 
all of it was to the same lawless tune Like a black pirate 
flag on the blue ocean of air, a hawk hung ominous ; then, 
plummet-wise, dropped to the hedgrow, whence there rose, 
thin and shrill, a piteous voice of squealing. By the time I 
got there a whisk of feathers on the turf — ^like scattered 
playbills — was all that remained to tell of the tragedy just 
enacted. Yet Nature smiled and sang on, pitiless, gay, 
impartial. To her, who took no sides, there was every bit 
as much to be said for the hawk as for the chaffinch. Both 
were her children, and she would show no preferences. 

Further on, a hedgehog lay dead athwart the path — nay.

more than dead ; decadent, distincdy ; a sorry sight for 
one that had known the fellow in more bustling circum- 
stances. Nature might at least have paused to shed one 
tear over this rough-jacketed little son of hers, for his wasted 
aims, his cancelled ambitions, his whole career of usefulness 
cut suddenly short. But not a bit of it ! Jubilant as ever, 
her song went bubbling on, and “ Death-in-Life ” — and 
again, “ Lifc-in-Death,” were its alternate burdens. And 
looking round, and seeing the sheep-nibbled heels of tur- 
nips that dotted the ground, their hearts eaten out of them 
in frost-bound days now over and done, I seemed to dis- 
cern, faintly, a something of the stern meaning in her 
valorous chant. 

My invisible companion was singing also, and seemed at 
times to be chuckling softly to himself, — doubtless at 
thought of the strange new lessons he was teaching me ; 
perhaps, too, at a special bit of waggishness he had still in 
store. For when at last he grew weary of such insignificant 
earth-bound company, he deserted me at a certain spot I 
knew ; then dropped, subsided and slunk away into 
nothingness. I raised my eyes, and before me, grim and 
lichened, stood the ancient whipping-post of the village ; 
its sides fretted with the initials of a generation that scorned 
its mute lesson, but still clipped by the stout rusty shackles 
that had tethered the wrists of such of that generation’s 
ancestors as had dared to mock at order and law. Had 
I been an infant Sterne, here was a grand chance for 
sentimental output ! As things were, I could only hurry 
homewards, my moral tail well between my legs, with an 
uneasy feeling, as I glanced back over my shoulder, that 
there was more in this chance than met the eye. 

And outside our gate I found Charlotte, alone and crying. 
Edward, it seemed, had persuaded her to hide, in the full 
expectation of being duly found and ecstatically pounced 
upon ; then he had caught sight of the butcher’s cart, and, 
forgetting his obligations, had rushed off for a ride. Harold, 
it further appeared, greatly coveting tadpoles, and top- 
heavy with the eagerness of possession, had fallen into the

A HOLIDAY 


pond. This, in itself, was nothing ; but on attempting to 
sneak in by the back-door, he had rendered up his duck- 
weed-bedabbled person into the hands of an aunt, and had 
been promptly sent off to bed ; and this, on a holiday, was 
very much. The moral of the whipping-post was working 
itself out ; and I was not in the least surprised when, on 
reaching home, I was seized upon and accused of doing 
something I had never even thought of. And my frame of 
mind was such, that I could only wish most heartily that 
I had done it. 



A WHITE-WASHED UNCLE 


I N our small lives that day was eventful when another 
unde was to come down from town, and submit his 
character and qualifications (albeit unconsciously) to our 
careful criticism. Earlier undes had been weighed in the 
balance, and — alas ! — ^found grievously wanting. There 
was Unde Thomas — a failure from the first. Not that his 
disposition was malevolent, nor were his habits such as 
to unfit him for decent society ; but his rooted conviction 
seemed to be that the reason of a child’s existence was to 
serve as a butt for senseless adult jokes — or what, from the 
accompanying guffaws of laughter, appeared to be intended 
for jokes. Now, we were anxious that he should have 
a perfectly fair trial ; so in the tool-house, between break- 
fast and lessons, we discussed and examined all his wittidsms 
one by one, calmly, critically, dispassionately. It was 
no good ! we could not discover any salt in them. And 
as only a genuine gift of humour could have saved Uncle 
Thomas — for he pretended to naught besides — he was 
reluctantly writ down a hopeless impostor. 

Unde George — the youngest — ^was distinctly more pro- 
mising. He accompanied us cheerily round the establish- 
ment — suffered himself to be introduced to each of the 
cows — ^held out the right hand of fellowship to the pig — 
and even hinted that a pair of pink-eyed Himalayan 
rabbits might arrive — unexpectedly — from town some day. 
We were just considering whether in this fertile soil an 
apparently accidental remark on the solid qualities of 
guinea-pigs or ferrets might haply blossom and bring forth 
fruit, when our governess appeared on the scene. Unde 
George’s manner at once underwent a complete and con- 
temptible change. His interest in rational topics seemed, 

9 



10 A WHITE-WASHED UNCLE 

“ like a fountain’s sickening pulse,” to flag and ebb away ;• 
and though Miss Smedley’s ostensible purpose was to take 
Selina for her usual walk, I can vouch for it that Selina 
spent her morning ratting, along with the keeper’s boy and 
me ; while if Miss Smedley walked with any one, it would 
appear to have been with Uncle George, 

But, despicable as his conduct had been, he underwent 
no hasty condemnation. The defection was discussed in all 
its bearings, but it seemed sadly clear at last that this uncle 
must possess some innate badness of character and fondness 
for low company. We who from daily experience knew 
Miss Smedley like a book — ^were we not only too well 
aware that she had neither accomplishments nor charms — 
no characteristic, in fact, but an inbred viciousness of 
temper and disposition ? True, she knew the dates of the 
English kings by heart ; but how could that profit Uncle 
George, who, having passed into the army, had ascended 
beyond the need of useful information? Our bows and 
arrows, on the other hand, had been freely placed at his 
disposal ; and a soldier should not have hesitated in his 
choice a moment. No : Uncle George had fallen from 
grace, and was unanimously damned. And the non- 
arrival of the Himalayan rabbits was only another nail 
in his coffin. Uncles, therefore, were just then a heavy 
and lifeless market, and there was little inclination to deal. 
Still It was agreed that Uncle William, who had just 
returned from India, should have as fair a trial as the 
others ; more especially as romantic possibilities might 
well be embodied in one who had held the gorgeous East 
in fee. 

Selina had kicked my shins — like the girl she is ! — 
during a scuffle in the passage, and I was still rubbing 
them with one hand when I found that the uncle-on- 
approbation was half-heartedly shaking the other. A 
florid, elderly man, quite unmistakably nervous, he let 
drop one grimy paw after another, and, turning very 
red, with an awkward simulation of heartiness, “ Well, 
h’are y’all ? ” he said, “ Glad to sec me, eh ? ” As wc 



A WHITE-WASHED UNCLE

could hardly, in justice, be expected to have formed 
an opinion on him at that early stage, we could but look 
at each other in silence ; which scarce served to relieve the 
tension of the situation. Indeed, the cloud never really 
lifted during his stay. In talking things over later, some 
one put forward the suggestion that he must at some time 
or other have committed a stupendous crime. But I could 
not bring myself to believe that the man, though evidently 
unhappy, was really guilty of anything ; and I caught 
him once or twice looking at us with evident kindliness, 
though, seeing himself observed, he blushed and turned 
away his head. 

When at last the atmosphere was clear of his depressing 
influence, we met despondently in the potato-cellar — all 
of us, that is, but Harold, who had been told off to accom- 
pany his relative to the station ; and the feeling was unani- 
mous that, as an uncle, William could not be allowed to 
pass. Selina roundly declared him a beast, pointing out 
that he had not even got us a half-holiday ; and, indeed, 
there seemed little to do but to pass sentence. We were 
about to put it to the vote, when Harold appeared on the 
scene ; his red face, round eyes, and mysterious demeanour, 
hinting at awful portents. Speechless he stood a space : 
then, slowly drawing his hand from the piocket of his 
knickerbockers, he displayed on a dirty palm one — two — 
three — four half-crowns ! We could but gaze — tranced, 
breathless, mute. Never had any of us seen, in the aggre- 
gate, so much bullion before. Then Harold told his talc. 

“ I took the old fellow to the station,” he said, “ and as 
we went along I told him all about the stationmaster’s 
family, and how I had seen the porter kissing our house- 
maid, and what a nice fellow he was, with no airs or 
affectation about him, and anything I thought would be of 
interest ; but he didn’t seem to pay much attention, but 
walked along puffing his cigar, and once I thought — I’m 
not certain, but I thought — I heard him say, ‘ Well, thank 
God, that’s over ! ’ When we got to the station he stopped 
suddenly, and said, ‘ Hold on a minute 1 ’ Then he shoved 



13 A WHITE-WASHED UNCLE 

these into my hand in a fnghtened sort of way, and saidj 
' Look here, youngster ! These are for you and the other 
kids. Buy what you like — ^make little beasts of yourselves 
— only don’t tell the old people, mind ! Now cut away 
home ! ’ So I cut.” 

A solemn hush fell on the assembly, broken first by the 
small Charlotte. “ I didn’t know,” she observed dreamily, 
“ that there were such good men anywhere in the world. 
I hope he’ll die to-night, for then he’ll go straight to 
heaven ! ” But the repentant Selina bewailed herself with 
tears and sobs, refusing to be comforted ; for that in her 
haste she had called this white-souled relative a beast. 

“ I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said Edward, the master- 
mind, rising — as he always did — to the situation : “ We’ll 
christen the piebald pig after him — the one that hasn’t 
got a name yet. And that’ll show we’re sorry for our 
mistake ! ” 

“ I — I christened that pig this morning,” Harold guiltily 
confessed ; “ I christened it after the curate. I’m very 
sorry — but he came and bowled to me last night, after 
you others had all been sent to bed early — and somehow 
I felt I had to do it ! ” 

“ Oh, but that doesn’t count,” said Edward hastily ; 
“ because we weren’t all there. We’ll take that christening 
off, and call it Uncle William. And you can save up the 
curate for the next litter ! ” 

And the motion being agreed to without a division, the 
House went into Committee of Supply. 



ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS 


“ T EX’S pretend,” suggested Harold, “ that we’re 

1 J Cavaliers and Roundheads ; and you be a Round- 
head ! ” 

“ O bother,” I replied drowsily, “ we pretended that 
yesterday ; and it’s not my turn to be a Roundhead, any- 
how.” The fact is, I was lazy, and the call to arms fell on 
indifferent ears. We three younger ones were stretched 
at length in the orchard. The sun was hot, the season 
merry June, and never (I thought) had there been such 
wealth and not of buttercups throughout the lush grass. 
Green-and-gold was the dominant key that day. Instead 
of active “ pretence ” with its shouts and its perspiration, 
how much better — I held — to lie at case and pretend to 
one’s self, in green and golden fancies, slipping the husk 
and passing, a careless lounger, through a sleepy imaginary 
world all gold and green ! But the persistent Harold was 
not to be fobbed off. 

” Well then,” he began afresh, “ let’s pretend we’re 
Knights of the Round Table ; and (with a rush) I'll be 
Lancelot ! ” 

“ I won’t play unless I’m Lancelot,” I said. I didn’t 
mean it really, but the game of Knights always began with 
this particular contest. 

“ O please," implored Harold. “ You know when 
Edward’s here I never get a chance of being Lancelot. 
I haven’t been Lancelot for weeks ! ” 

Then I yielded gracefully. “ All right,” I said. “ I’ll 
be Tristram ” 

“ O, but you can’t,” cried Harold again. “ Charlotte 
has always been Tristram. She won’t play unless she’s 
allowed to be Tristram ! Be somebody else this time.” 

13 



14 ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS 

Charlotte said nothing, but breathed hard, looking 
straight before her. The peerless hunter and harper was 
her special hero of romance, and rather than see the part 
in less appreciative hands, she would have gone back in 
tears to the stuffy schoolroom. 

“ I don’t care,” I said : “ I’ll be anything. I’ll be Sir 
Kay. Come on ! ” 

Then once more in this country’s story the mail-clad 
knights paced through the greenwood shaw, questing 
adventure, redressing wrong ; and bandits, five to one, 
broke and fled discomfited to their caves. Once more 
were damsels rescued, dragons disembowelled, and giants, 
in every corner of the orchard, deprived of their already 
superfluous number of heads ; while Palomides the Saracen 
waited for us by the well, and Sir Breuse Saunce Pitc 
vanished in craven flight before the skilled spear that was 
his terror and his bane. Once more the lists were dight in 
Camelot, and all was gay with shimmer of silk and gold ; 
the earth shook with thunder of hooves, ash-staves flew in 
splinters, and the firmament rang to the clash of sword on 
helm. The varying fortune of the day swung doubtful — 
now on this side, now on that ; till at last Lancelot, grim 
and great, thrusting through the press, unhorsed Sir 
Tristram (an easy task), and bestrode her, threatening 
doom ; while the Cornish knight, forgetting hard-won 
fame of old, cried piteously, “ You’re hurting me, I tell 
you ! and you’re tearing my frock ! ” Then it happened 
that Sir Kay, hurding to the rescue, stopped short in his 
stride, catching sight suddenly, through apple-boughs, of 
a gleam of scarlet afar off ; while the conned tramp of 
many horses, mingled with talk and laughter, was borne 
to the ears of his fellow-champions and himself. 

“ What is It ? ” inquired Tristram, sitting up and 
shaking out her curls ; while Lancelot forsook the clanging 
lists and trotted nimbly to the boundary-hedge. 

1 stood spell-bound for a moment longer, and then, with 
a cry of “ Soldiers ! ” I was off to the hedge. Sir Tristram 
picking herself up and scurrying after us.

* Down the road they came, two and two, at an easy walk; 
scarlet flamed in the eye, bits jingled and saddles squeaked 
delightfully ; while the men, in a halo of dust, smoked 
their short clays like the heroes they were. In a swirl of 
intoxicating glory the troop clinked and clattered by, 
while we shouted and waved jumping up and down, and 
the big jolly horsemen acknowledged the salute with easy 
condescension. The moment they were past we were 
through the hedge and after them. Soldiers were not the 
common stuff of everyday life. There had been nothing 
like this since the winter before last, when on a certain 
afternoon — ^bare of leaf and monochromatic in its hue of 
sodden fallow and frost-nipt copse — suddenly the hounds 
had burst through the fence with their mellow cry, and all 
the paddock was for the minute reverberant of thudding 
hoof and dotted with glancing red. But this was better, 
since it could only mean that blows and bloodshed were in 
the air. 

“ Is there going to be a battle ? ” panted Harold, hardly 
able to keep up for excitement. 

“ Of course there is,” I replied. “ We’re just in time. 
Come on ! ” 

Perhaps I ought to have known better ; and yet ? 

The pigs and poultry, with whom we chiefly consorted, 
could instruct us little concerning the peace that lapped in 
these latter days our seagirt realm. In the schoolroom we 
were just now dallying with the Wars of the Roses ; and 
did not legends of the country-side inform us how cavaliers 
had once galloped up and down these very lanes from their 
quarters in the village ? Here, now, were soldiers un- 
mistakable ; and if their business was not fighting, what 
was it ? Sniffing the joy of battle, we followed hard in their 
tracks. 

“ Won’t Edward be sorry,” puffed Harold, “ that he’s 
begun that beastly Latin ? ” 

It did, indeed, seem hard. Edward, the most martial 
spirit of us all, was drearily conjugating am (of all verbs !) 
between four waUs ; while Selina, who ever thrilled

ecstatic to a red coat, was struggling with the uncouth 
German tongue. “ Age,” I reflected, “ carries its penalties.” 

It was a grievous disappointment to us that the troop 
passed through the village unmolested. Every cottage, 
I pointed out to my companions, ought to have been loop- 
holed, and strongly held. But no opposition was offered 
to the soldiers ; who, indeed, conducted themselves with 
a recklessness and a want of precaution that seemed simply 
criminal. 

At the last cottage a transitory gleam of common sense 
flickered across me, and, turning on Charlotte, I sternly 
ordered her back. The small maiden, docile but exceed- 
ingly dolorous, dragged reluctant feet homewards, heavy 
at heart that she was to behold no stout fellows slain that 
day ; but Harold and I held steadily on, expecting every 
instant to see the environing hedges crackle and spit forth 
the leaden death. 

“ Will they be Indians ? ” asked my brother (meaning 
the enemy), “ or Roundheads, or what ? ” 

I reflected. Harold always required direct straight- 
forward answers — not faltering suppositions. 

“ They won’t be Indians,” I replied at last ; “ nor yet 
Roundheads. There haven’t been any Roundheads seen 
about here for a long time. They’ll be Frenchmen.” 

Harold’s face fell. “ All right,” he said : “ Frenchmen’ll 
do ; but I did hope they’d be Indians.” 

“ If they were going to be Indians,” I explained, “ I — 
I don’t think I’d go on. Because when Indians take you 
prisoner they scalp you first, and then burn you at the 
stake. But Frenchmen don’t do that sort of thing.” 

” Are you quite sure ? ” asked Harold doubtfully. 

“ Quite,” I replied. “ Frenchmen only shut you up in a 
thing called the Bastille ; and then you get a file sent in 
to you in a loaf of bread, and saw the bars through, and 
slide down a rope, and they all fire at you — but they don’t 
hit you — and you run down to the seashore as hard as 
you can, and swim off to a British frigate, and there you 
are !” 



ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS 17 

&lt;Harold brightened up again. The programme was 
rather attractive. “ If they try to take us prisoner,” he 
said, ” we — ^we won’t run, will we ? ” 

Meanwhile, the craven foe was a long time showing 
himself ; and we were reaching strange outland country, 
uncivilized, wherein lions might be expected to prowl at 
nightfall. I had a stitch in my side, and both Harold’s 
stockings had come down. Just as I was beginning to have 
gloomy doubts of the proverbial courage of Frenchmen, 
the officer called out something, the men closed up, and, 
breaking into a trot, the troops — already far ahead — 
vanished out of our sight. With a sinking at the heart, 
I began to suspect we had been fooled. 

“ Are they charging ? ” cried Harold, very weary, but 
rallying gamely. 

“ I think not,” I replied doubtfully. “ When there’s 
going to be a charge, the officer always makes a speech, 
and then they draw their swords and the trumpets blow, 
and — but let’s try a short cut. We may catch them up 
yet.” 

So we struck across the helds and into another road, and 
pounded down that, and then over more fields, panting, 
down-hearted, yet hoping for the best. The sun went in, 
and a thin drizzle began to fall; we were muddy, breathless, 
almost dead-beat ; but we blundered on, till at last we 
struck a road more brutally, more callously unfamiliar 
than any road I ever looked upon. Not a hint nor a sign 
of friendly direction or assistance on the dogged white 
face of it ! There was no longer any disguising it : we 
were hopelessly lost. The small rain continued steadily, 
the evening began to come on. Really there are moments 
when a fellow is justified in crying ; and I would have 
cried too, if Harold had not been there. That right- 
minded child regarded an elder brother as a veritable god ; 
and I could see that he felt himself as secure as if a whole 
Brigade of Guards had hedged him round with protecting 
bayonets. But I dreaded sore lest he should begin again 
with his questions.

As I gazed in dumb appeal on the face of unresponsive 
nature, the sound of nearing wheels sent a pulse of hope 
through my being ; increasing to rapture as I recognized 
in the approaching vehicle the familiar carriage of the old 
doctor. If ever a god emerged from a machine, it was 
when this heaven-sent friend, recognizing tis, stopped and 
jumped out with a cheery hail. Harold rushed up to 
him at once. “ Have you been there ? ” he cried. “ Was 
it a jolly fight ? who beat ? were there many people 
kiUed ? ” 

The doctor appeared puzzled. I briefly explained the 
situation. 

“ I see,” said the doctor, looking grave and twisting his 
face this way and that. “ Well, the fact is, there isn’t 
going to be any battle to-day. It’s been put off on account 
of the change in the weather. You will have due notice of 
the renewal of hostilities. And now you’d better jump in 
and I’ll drive you home. You’ve been running a fine 
rig ! Why, you might have both been taken and shot as 
spies ! ” 

This special danger had never even occurred to us. 
The thrill of it accentuated the cosy homelike feeling of 
the cushions we nestled into as we rolled homewards. 
The doctor beguiled the journey with blood-curdling 
narratives of personal adventure in the tented field, he 
having followed the profession of arms (so it seemed) in 
every quarter of the globe. Time, the destroyer of all 
things beautiful, subsequently revealed the baselessness of 
these legends ; but what of that ? There are higher things 
than truth ; and we were almost reconciled, by the time 
we were put down at our gate, to the fact that the battle 
had been postponed. 



THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS 


I T was the day I was promoted to a toothbrush. The 
girls, irrespective of age, had been thus distinguished 
some time before ; why, we boys could never rightly 
understand, except that it was part and parcel of a system 
of studied favouritism on behalf of creatures both physically 
inferior and (as was shown by a fondness for tale-bearing) 
of weaker mental fibre to us boys. It was not that we 
yearned after these strange instruments in themselves. 
Edward, indeed, applied his to the scrubbing-out of his 
squirrel’s cage, and for personal use, when a superior eye 
was grim on him, borrowed Harold’s or mine, indifferently. 
But the nimbus of distinction that clung to them — that we 
coveted exceedingly. What more, indeed, was there to 
ascend to, before the remote, but still possible, razor 
and strop ? 

Perhaps the exaltation had mounted to my head ; or 
nature and the perfect morning joined to hint at dis- 
affection. Anyhow, having breakfasted, and triumphantly 
repeated the collect I had broken down in the Itist Sunday 
— ’twas one without rhythm or alhteration : a most ob- 
jectionable collect — having achieved thus much, the small 
natural man in me rebelled, and I vowed, as I straddled 
and spat about the stablc-yard in feeble imitation of the 
coachman, that lessons might go to the Inventor of them. 
It was only geography that morning, any way : and the 
practical thing was worth any quantity of bookish theoric. 
As for me, I was going on my travels, and imports and 
exports, population and capitals, might very well wait 
while I explored the breathing coloured world outside. 

True, a fellow-rebel was wanted ; and Harold might, 
as a rule, have been counted on with certainty. But just 
then Harold was very proud. The week before he had

“ gone into tables,” and had been endowed with a ne^fr 
slate, having a miniature sponge attached wherewith we 
washed the faces of Charlotte’s dolls, thereby producing an 
unhealthy pallor which struck terror into the child’s heart, 
always timorous regarding epidemic visitations. As to 
“ tables,” nobody knew exactly what they were, least of 
all Harold ; but it was a step over the heads of the rest, 
and therefore a subject of self-adulation and — generally 
speaking — airs ; so that Harold, hugging his slate and his 
chains, was out of the question now. In such a matter, 
girls were worse than useless, as wanting the necessary 
tenacity of will and contempt for self-constituted authority. 
So eventually I slipped through the hedge a solitary 
protestant, and issued forth on the lane what time the rest 
of the civilized world was sitting down to lessons. 

The scene was familiar enough ; and yet, this morning, 
how different it all seemed ' The act, with its daring, 
tinted everything with new strange hues ; affecting the 
individual with a sort of brmsed feeling just below the pit 
of the stomach, that was intensified whenever his thoughts 
flew back to the ink-stained smelly schoolroom And 
could this be really me ^ or was I only contemplating, 
from the schoolroom aforesaid, some other jolly young 
mutineer, faring forth under the genial sun ^ Anyhow, 
here was the friendly well, in its old place, halfway up the 
lane. Hither the yoke-shouldering village-folk were wont 
to come to fill their clinking buckets ; when the drippings 
made worms of wet in the thick dust of the road They 
had flat wooden crosses inside each pail, which floated on 
the top and (we were instructed) served to prevent the 
water from slopping over. We used to wonder by what 
magic this strange principle worked, and who first invented 
the crosses, and whether he got a peerage for it. But 
indeed the well was a centre of mystery, for a hornet’s 
nest was somewhere hard by, and the very thought was 
fearsome. Wasps we knew well and disdained, storming 
them in their fastnesses. But these great Beasts, vestured 
in angry orange, three stings from which — so ’twas averred

•—would kill a horse, these were of a different kidney, and 
their dreadful drone suggested prudence and retreat. At 
this time neither villagers nor hornets encroached on the 
stillness : lessons, apparendy, pervaded all Nature. So, 
after dabbling awhile in the well — ^what boy has ever 
passed a bit of water without messing in it ? — I scrambled 
through the hedge, shunning the hornet-haunted side, 
and struck into the silence of the copse. 

If the lane had been deserted, this was loneliness become 
personal Here mystery lurked and peeped ; here 
brambles caught and held you with a purpose of their own ; 
here saplings whipped your face with human spite. The 
copse, too, proved vaster in extent, more direfully drawn 
out, than one would ever have guessed from its frontage 
on the lane • and I was really glad when at last the wood 
opened and sloped down to a streamlet brawling forth 
into the sunlight By this cheery companion I wandered 
along, conscious of little but that Nature, in providing 
store of water-rats, had thoughtfully furnished provender 
of right-sized stones Rapids, also, there were, telling of 
canoes and portages — ennkhng bays and inlets — caves for 
pirates and hidden treasures — the wise Dame had forgotten 
nothing — till at last, aftei what lapse of time I know not, 
my further course, though not the stream’s, was barred by 
some six feet of stout wire netting, stretched from side to 
side just where a thick hedge, arching till it touched, 
forbade all further view. 

The excitement of the thing was becoming thrilling. A 
Black Flag must surely be fluttering close by ? Here was 
most plainly a malignant contrivance of the Pirates, 
designed to baffle our gun-boats when we dashed up- 
stream to shell them from their lair ! A gun-boat, indeed, 
might well have hesitated, so stout was the netting, so 
close the hedge. But I spied where a rabbit was wont to 
pass, close down by the water’s edge ; where a rabbit 
could go a boy could follow, howbeit stomach-wise and 
ivith one leg in the stream ; so the passage was achieved, 
and I stood inside, safe but breathless at the sight.

THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS 

Gone was the brambled waste, gone the flickering tangle 
of woodland. Instead, terrace after terrace of shaven 
sward, stone-edged, urn-cornered, stepped delicately down 
to where the stream, now tamed and educated, passed 
from one to another marble basin, in which on occasion 
gleams of red hinted at gold-fish poised among the spreading 
water-lilies. The scene lay silent and slumbrous in the 
brooding noonday sun : the drowsing peacock squatted 
humped on the lawn, no fish leaped in the pools, no bird 
declared himself from the trim secluding hedges. Self- 
confessed it was here, then, at last, the Garden of 
Sleep ! 

Two things, in those old days, I held in especial distrust ; 
gamekeepers and gardeners. Seeing, however, no baleful 
apparitions of either quality, I pursued my way between 
rich flower-beds, in search of the necessary Princess. 
Conditions declared her presence patently as trumpets ; 
without this centre such surroundings could not exist. A 
pavilion, gold-topped, wreathed with lush jessamine, 
beckoned with a special significance over close-set shrubs. 
There, if anywhere. She should be enshrined. Instinct, 
and some knowledge of the habits of princesses, triumphed ; 
for (indeed) there She was ! In no tranced repose, however, 
but laughingly, struggling to disengage her hand from the 
grasp of a grown-up man who occupied the marble bench 
with her. (As to age, I suppose now that the two swung 
in respective scales that pivoted on twenty. But children 
heed no minor distinctions. To them, the inhabited world 
IS composed of the two main divisions ; children and up- 
grown people ; the latter in no way superior to the former 
— only hopelessly different. These two, then, belonged to 
the grown-up section.) I paused, thinking it strange they 
should prefer seclusion when there were fish to be caught, 
and butterflies to hunt in the sun outside ; and as I 
cogitated thus, the grown-up man caught sight of me. 

“ Hallo, sprat ! ” he said with some abruptness ; “where 
do you spring from ? ” 

“ I came up the stream,” I explained politely and 



THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS 


23 

comprehensively, “ and I was only looking for the 
Princess.” 

“ Then you are a water-baby,” he replied. “ And what 
do you think of the Princess, now you’ve found her ? ” 

“ I think she is lovely,” I said (and doubtless I was 
right, having never learned to flatter). “ But she’s wide- 
awake, so I suppose somebody has kissed her ! ” 

This very natural deduction moved the grown-up man 
to laughter ; but the Princess, turning red and jumping 
up, declared that it was time for lunch. 

“ Come along, then,” said the grown-up man ; “ and 
you too, Water-baby. Come and have something solid. 
You must want it.” 

I accompanied them without any feeling of false delicacy. 
The world, as known to me, was spread with food each 
several mid-day, and the particular table one sat at seemed 
a matter of no importance. The palace was very sumptuous 
and beautiful, just what a palace ought to be ; and we 
were met by a stately lady, rather more grown-up than 
the Princess — apparently her mother. My friend the Man 
was very kind, and introduced me as the Captain, saying 
I had just run down from Aldershot. I didn’t know where 
Aldershot was, but I had no manner of doubt that he was 
perfectly right. As a rule, indeed, grown-up people are 
fairly correct on matters of fact ; it is in the higher gift of 
imagination that they are so sadly to seek. 

The lunch was excellent and varied Another gentleman 
in beautiful clothes — a lord presumably — lifted me into 
a high carved chair, and stood behind it, brooding over 
me like a Providence. I endeavoured to explain who I 
was and where I had come from, and to impress the 
company with my own toothbrush and Harold’s tables ; 
but either they were stupid — or is it a characteristic of 
Fairyland that every one laughs at the most ordinary 
remarks ? My friend the Man said good-naturedly, “ All 
right. Water-baby ; you came up the stream, and that’s 
good enough for us.” The lord — a reserved sort of man, 
1 thought — took no share in the conversation. 



24 THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS 

After lunch I walked on the terrace with the Princess 
and my friend the Man, and was very proud. And I told 
him what I was going to be, and he told me what he was 
going to be ; and then I remarked, “ I suppose you two 
are going to get married ? ” He only laughed, after the 
Fairy fashion. “ Because if you aren’t,” I added, ” you 
really ought to ” : meaning only that a man who discovered 
a Princess, living in the right sort of Palace like this, and 
didn’t marry her there and then, was false to all recognized 
tradition. 

They laughed again, and my friend suggested I should 
go down to the pond and look at the gold-fish, while they 
went for a stroll. I was sleepy, and assented ; but before 
they left me, the grown-up man put two half-crowns in 
my hand, for the purpose, he explained, of treating the 
other water-babies. I was so touched by this crowning 
mark of friendship that I nearly cried ; and I thought 
much more of his generosity than of the fact that the 
Princess, ere she moved away, stooped down and kissed me. 

I watched them disappear down the path — ^how naturally 
arms seem to go round waists in Fairyland ! — and then, 
my cheek on the cool marble, lulled by the trickle of water, 
I slipped into dreamland out of real and magic world 
alike. When I woke, the sun had gone in, a chill wind set 
all the leaves a-whispering, and the peacock on the lawn 
was harshly calling up the rain. A wild unreasoning panic 
possessed me, and I sped out of the garden like a gmlty 
thing, wriggled through the rabbit-run, and threaded my 
doubtful way homewards, hounded by nameless terrors. 
The half-crowns happily remained sohd and real to the 
touch ; but could I hope to bear such treasure safely 
through the brigand-haunted wood ? It was a dirty, 
weary little object that entered its home, at nightfall, by 
the unassuming aid of the scullery-window : and only to 
be sent tealess to bed seemed infinite mercy to him. 
Officially tealess, that is ; for, as was usual after such 
escapades, a sympathetic housemaid, coming delicately by 
backstairs, stayed him with chunks of cold pudding and 



THE FINDING OF THE PRINCESS 25 

'condolence, till his small skin was tight as any drum. 
Then, nature asserting herself, I passed into the comforting 
kingdom of sleep, where, a golden carp of fattest bmld, 
I oared it in translucent waters with a new half-crown 
snug under right fin and left ; and thrust up a nose through 
water-lily leaves to be kissed by a rose-flushed Princess, 



SAWDUST AND SIN 


A BELT of rhododendrons grew close down to one 
side of our pond ; and along the edge of it many 
things flourished rankly. If you crept through the under- 
growth and crouched by the water’s rim, it was easy — if 
your imagination were in healthy working order — to 
transport yourself in a trice to the heart of a tropical 
forest. Overhead the monkeys chattered, parrots flashed 
from bough to bough, strange large blossoms shone all 
round you, and the push and rustle of great beasts moving 
unseen thrilled you deliciously. And if you lay down with 
your nose an inch or two from the water, U was not long 
ere the old sense of proportion vanished clean away. The 
glittering insects that darted to and fro on its surface 
became sea-monsters dire, the gnats that hung above them 
swelled to albatrosses, and the pond itself stretched out 
into a vast inland sea, whereon a navy might ride secure, 
and whence at any moment the hairy scalp of a sea- 
serpent might be seen to emerge. 

It is impossible, however, to play at tropical forests 
properly, when homely accents of the human voice intrude ; 
and all my hopes of seeing a tiger seized by a crocodile 
while drinking {vide picture-books, passim) vamshed 
abruptly, and earth resumed her old dimensions, when 
the sound of Charlotte’s prattle somewhere hard by broke 
in on my primteval seclusion. Looking out from the 
bushes, I saw her trotting towards an open space of lawn 
the other side the pond, chattering to herself in her accus- 
tomed fashion, a doll tucked under either arm, and her 
brow knit with care. Propping up her double burthen 
against a friendly stump, she sat down in front of them, 
as full of worry and anxiety as a Chancellor on a Budget 
night.

'Her victims, who stared resignedly in front of them, 
were recognizable as Jerry and Rosa. Jerry hailed from 
far Japan : his hair was straight and black, his one garment 
cotton of a simple blue ; and his reputation was distinctly 
bad. Jerome was his proper name, from his supposed 
likeness to the holy man who hung in a print on the stair- 
case ; though a shaven crown was the only thing in 
common ’twixt Western saint and Eastern sinner. Rosa 
was typical British, from her flaxen poll to the stout calves 
she displayed so liberally ; and in character she was of 
the blameless order of those who have not yet been found 
out. 

I suspected Jerry from the first. There was a latent 
devilry in his slant eyes as he sat there moodily ; and 
knowing what he was capable of, I scented trouble in 
store for Charlotte Rosa I was not so sure about ; she 
sat demurely and upright, and looked far away into the 
tree-tops in a visionary, world-forgetting sort of way ; 
yet the prim purse of her mouth was somewhat overdone, 
and her eyes glittered unnaturally. 

“ Now, I’m going to begin where I left off,” said 
Charlotte, regardless of stops, and thumping the turf 
with her fist excitedly . “ and you must pay attention, 
’cos this is a treat, to have a story told you before you’re 
put to bed. Well, so the White Rabbit scuttled off down 
the passage and Alice hopicd he’d come back ’cos he had 
a waistcoat on and her flamingo flew up a tree — but we 
haven’t got to that part yet, you must wait a minute, and 
— where had I got to ? ” 

Jerry only remained passive until Charlotte had got 
well under way, and then began to heel over quietly in 
Rosa’s direction. His head fell on her plump shoulder, 
causing her to start nervously. 

Charlotte seized and shook him with vigour. “ O 
Jerit,” she cried piteously, “ if you’re not going to be 
good, how ever shall I tell you my story ? ” 

Jerry’s face was injured innocence itself. “ Blame if you 
like, Madam,” he seemed to say, “ the eternal laws of 



28 SAWDUST AND SIN 

gravitation, but not a helpless puppet, who is also an 
orphan and a stranger in the land.” 

“ Now we’ll go on,” began Charlotte once more. “ So 
she got into the garden at last — I’ve left out a lot but you 
won’t care, I’ll tell you some other time — and they were 
all playing croquet, and that’s where the flamingo comes 
in, and the Queen shouted out, ‘ Off with her head 1 ’ ” 

At this point Jerry collapsed forward, suddenly and 
completely, his bald pate between his knees. Charlotte 
was not very angry this time. The sudden development 
of tragedy in the story had evidently been too much for 
the poor fellow. She straightened him out, wiped his 
nose, and, after trying him m various positions, to which 
he refused to adapt himself, she propped him against the 
shoulder of the (apparently) unconscious Rosa. Then my 
eyes were opened, and the full measure of Jerry’s infamy 
became apparent. This, then, was what he had been 
playing up for ! The rascal had designs, had he ? I resolved 
to keep him under close observation 

“ If you’d been in the garden,” went on Charlotte 
reproachfully, “ and flopped down like that when the 
Queen said ‘ Off with his head 1 ’ she’d have offed with 
your head ; but Alice wasn’t that sort of girl at all. She 
just said, ‘ I’m not afraid of you, you’re nothing but a 
pack of cards ’ — O dear ! I’ve got to the end already, and 
I hadn’t begun hardly ! I never can make my stories last 
out ! Never mind. I’ll tell you another one.” 

Jerry didn’t seem to care, now he had gained his end, 
whether the stories lasted out or not He was nestling 
against Rosa’s plump form with a look of satisfaction that 
was simply idiotic ; and one arm had disappeared from 
view — was it round her waist ? Rosa’s natural blush 
seemed deeper than usual, her head inclined shyly — ^it 
must have been round her waist. 

“ If it wasn’t so near your bedtime,” continued Charlotte 
reflectively, “ I’d tell you a nice story with a bogey in it. 
But you’d be frightened, and you’d dream of bogies all 
night. So I’ll tell you one about a White Bear, only you 



SAWDUST AND SIN 29 

mustn’t scream when the bear says ‘ Wow,’ like I used to, 
’cos he’s a good bear really ” 

Here Rosa fell flat on her back in the deadest of faints. 
Her limbs were rigid, her eyes glassy. What had Jerry 
decn doing ? It must have been something very bad, for 
her to take on like that. I scrutinized him carefully, while 
Charlotte ran to comfort the damsel. He appeared to be 
whistling a tune and regarding the scenery. If I only 
possessed Jerry’s command of feature, I thought to myself, 
half regretfully, I would never be found out in anything. 

“ It’s all your fault, Jerry,” said Charlotte reproachfully, 
when the lady had been restored to consciousness : “ Rosa’s 
as good as gold except when you make her wicked. I’d 
put you in the corner, only a stump hasn’t got a corner 
— wonder why that is ? Thought everything had comers. 
Never mind, you’ll have to sit with your face to the wall 
— so. Now you can sulk if you like ! ” 

Jerry seemed to hesitate a moment between the bliss of 
indulgence in sulks with a sense of injury, and the impel iou- 
summons of beauty waiting to be wooed at his elbow ; 
then, overmastered by his passion, he fell sideways across 
Rosa’s lap One arm stuck stiffly upwards, as in passionate 
protestation ; his amorous countenance was full of entreaty. 
Rosa hesitated — wavered — ^yielded, crushing his slight 
frame under the weight of her full-bodied surrender. 

Charlotte had stood a good deal, but it was possible to 
abuse even her patience Snatching Jerry from his lawless 
embraces, she reversed him across her knee, and then — 
the outrage offered to the whole superior sex in Jerry’s 
hapless person was too painfiJ to witness ; but though 
I turned my head away the sound of brisk slaps continued 
to reach my tingling ears. When I dared to look again, 
Jerry was sitting up as before ; his garment, somewhat 
crumpled, was restored to its original position ; but his 
pallid countenance was set hard. Knowing 2is I did, only 
too weU, what a volcano of passion and shame must be 
seething under that impassive exterior, for the moment 
I felt sorry for him. 



30 SAWDUST AND SIN 

Rosa’s face was still buried in her frock ; it might have 
been shame, it might have been grief for Jerry’s sufferings. 
But the callous Japanese never even looked her way. His 
heart was exceeding bitter within him. In merely following 
up his natural impulses he had run his head against con&gt; 
vention, and learned how hard a thing it was ; and the 
sunshiny world was all black to him. Even Charlotte 
softened somewhat at the sight of his rigid misery. “ If 
you’ll say you’re sorry, Jerome,” she said, “ I’ll say I’m 
sorry too.” 

Jerry only dropped his shoulders against the stump and 
stared out m the direction of his dear native Japan, where 
love was no sin, and smacking had not been introduced. 
Why had he ever left it ? He would go back to-morrow ! 
And yet there were obstacles : another grievance. Nature, 
in endowing Jerry with every grace of form and feature, 
along with a sensitive soul, had somehow forgotten the 
gift of locomotion. 

There was a crackling in the bushes behind me, with 
sharp short pants as of a small steam-engine, and Rollo, 
the black retriever, just released from his chain by some 
friendly hand, burst through the underwood, seeking con- 
genial company I joyfully hailed him to stop and be a 
panther, but he sped away round the pond, upset Charlotte 
with a boisterous caress, and seizing Jerry by the middle, 
disappeared with him down the drive. Charlotte pandng, 
raved behind the swift-footed avenger of crime , Rosa 
lay dishevelled, bereft of consciousness ; Jerry himself 
spread helpless arms to heaven, and I almost thought I 
heard a cry for mercy, a tardy promise of amendment. 
But It was too late. The Black Man had got Jerry at last ; 
and though the tear of sensibility might bedew an eye or 
two for his lost sake, no one who really knew him could 
deny the justice of his fate. 



THE BURGLARS 


I T was much too fine a night to think of going to bed 
at once, and so, although the witching hour of nine p.m. 
had struck, Edward and I were still leaning out of the 
open window in our nightshirts, watching the play of the 
cedar-branch shadows on the moonlit lawn, and planning 
schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow. From 
below, strains of the jocund piano declared that the 
Olympians were enjoying themselves in their listless 
impotent way ; for the new curate had been bidden to 
dinner that night, and was at the moment unclerically 
proclaiming to all the world that he feared no foe. His 
discordant vociferations doubtless started a tram of thought 
in Edward’s mind, for he presently remarked, d propos of 
nothing whatever that had been said before, “ I believe 
the new curate’s rather gone on Aunt Maria.” 

I scouted the notion. “ Why, she’s quite old,” I said. 
(She must have seen some five-and-twenty summers.) 

“ Of course she is,” replied Edward scornfully. “ It’s 
not her, it’s her money he’s after, you bet ! ” 

“ Didn’t know she had any money,” I observed timidly. 
“ Sure to have,” said my brother with confidence. 
“ Heaps and heaps.” 

Silence ensued, both our minds being busy with the 
new situation thus presented : mine, in wonderment at 
this flaw that so often declared itself in enviable natures of 
fullest endowment, — ^in a grown-up man and a good 
cricketer, for instance, even as this curate ; Edward’s 
(apparently) in the consideration of how such a state of 
things, supposing it existed, could be best turned to his 
own advantage. 



32 THE BURGLARS 

“ Bobby Ferris told me,” began Edward in due course, 
“ that there was a fellow spooning his sister once ” 

” What’s spooning ? ” I asked meekly. 

“07 dunno,” said Edward indifferently. “ It’s — it’s 
— it’s just a thing they do, you know. And he used to 
carry notes and messages and things between ’em, and he 
got a shilling almost every time.” 

“ What, from each of ’em ? ” I innocently inquired. 

Edward looked at me with scornful pity. “ Girls never 
have any money,” he briefly explained. “ But she did 
his exercises, and got him out of rows, and told stories for 
him when he needed it — and much better ones than he 
could have made up for himself. Girls are useful in some 
ways. So he was living in clover, when unfortunately 
they went and quarrelled about something ” 

“ Don’t see what that’s got to do with it,” I said. 

” Nor don’t I,” rejoined Edward. “ But anyhow the 
notes and things stopped, and so did the shillings. Bobby 
was fairly cornered, for he had bought two ferrets on tick, 
and promised to pay a shilling a week, thinking the shillings 
were going on for ever, the silly young ass. So when the 
week was up, and he was being dunned for the shilling, he 
went off to the fellow and said : ‘ Your broken-hearted 
Bella implores you to meet her at sundown. By the 
hollow oak as of old, be it only for a moment. Do not 
fail ! ’ He got all that out of some rotten book, of course. 
The fellow looked puzzled and said : 

” ‘ What hollow oak ? I don’t know any hollow oak.’ 

“ ‘ Perhaps it was the Royal Oak ? ’ said Bobby promptly, 
’cos he saw he had made a slip, through trusting too much 
to the rotten book ; but this didn’t seem to make the 
fellow any happier.” 

“ Should think not,” I said, “ the Royal Oak’s an awful 
low sort of pub.” 

“ I know,” said Edward. “ Well, at last the fellow 
said, ‘ I think 1 know what she means : the hollow tree 
in your father’s paddock. It happens to be an elm, but 
she wouldn’t know the difference. All right : say I’ll be 



THE BURGLARS

there.’ Bobby hung about a bit, for he hadn’t got his 
money. ‘ She was crying awfully,’ he said. Then he got 
his shilling.” 

“ And wasn’t the fellow riled,” I inquired, “ when he 
got to the place and found nothing ? ” 

“ He found Bobby,” said Edward indignantly. “ Young 
Ferris was a gendeman, every inch of him. He brought 
the fellow another message from Bella : ‘ I dare not leave 
the house. My cruel parents immure me closely. If you 
only knew what I suffer. Your broken-hearted Bella.’ 
Out of the same rotten book. This made the fellow a litde 
suspicious, ’cos it was the old Ferrises who had been keen 
about the thing all through. The fellow, you see, had tin ” 
“ But what’s that got to—” I began again. 

“ O / dunno,” said Edward impatiently. “ I’m telling 
you just what Bobby told me. He got suspicious, anyhow, 
but he couldn’t exactly call Bella’s brother a liar, so l^bby 
escaped for the time. But when he was in a hole next week, 
over a stiff French exercise, and tried the same sort of game 
on his sister, she was too sharp for him, and he got caught 
out. Somehow women seem more mistrustful than men. 
They’re so beasdy suspicious by nature, you know ” 

“ I know,” said I. “ But did the two — the fellow and 
the sister — make it up afterwards ? ” , 

“ I don’t remember about that,” replied Edward in- 
differently ; “ but Bobby got packed off to school a whole 
year earlier than his people meant to send him. Which 
was just what he wanted. So you see it all came right in 
the end ! ” 

I was trying to puzzle out the moral of this story — it was 
evidently meant to contain one somewhere — ^when a flood 
of golden lamplight mingled with the moon-rays on the 
lawn, and Aunt Maria and the new curate strolled out on 
the grass below us, and took the direction of a garden-seat 
which was backed by a dense laurel shrubbery reaching 
round in a half'circle to the house. Edward meditated 
moodily. “ If we only knew what they were talking about,” 
said he, “ you’d soon see whether I was right or not. Look

here ! Let’s send the kid down by the porch to recon&gt; 
noitre ! ” 

“ Harold’s asleep,” I said ; “ it seems rather a 

shame ” 

“ O rot ! ” said my brother ; “ he’s the youngest, and 
he’s got to do as he’s told ! ” 

So the luckless Harold was hauled out of bed and given 
his sailing-orders. He was naturally rather vexed at being 
stood up suddenly on the cold floor, and the job had no 
particular interest for him ; but he was both staunch and 
well disciplined. The means of exit were simple enough. 
A porch of iron trellis came up to within easy reach of the 
window, and was habitually used by all three of us, when 
modestly anxious to avoid public notice. Harold climbed 
defdy down the porch like a white rat, and his night-gown 
glimmered a moment on the gravel walk ere he was lost to 
sight in the darkness of the shrubbery. A brief intervai 
of silence ensued ; broken suddenly by a sound of scuffle, 
and then a shrill long-drawn squeal, as of metallic surfaces 
in friction. Our scout had fallen into the hands of the 
enemy ' 

Indolence alone had made us devolve the task of in- 
vestigation on our younger brother. Now that danger had 
declared itself, there was no hesitation. In a second we were 
down the side of the piorch, and crawling Cherokee-wise 
through the laurels to the back of the garden-seat. Piteous 
was the sight that greeted us. Aunt Maria was on the seat, 
in a white evening frock, looking — ^for an aunt — ^really 
quite nice. On the lawn stood an incensed curate, grasping 
our small brother by a large ear, which— judging from the 
row he was meiking — seemed on the point of parting com- 
pany with the head it completed and adorned. The grue- 
some noise he was emitting did not really affect us otherwise 
than aesthetically. To one who has tried both, the wail of 
genuine physical anguish is easily distinguishable from the 
pumped-up ad misertcordtam blubber. Harold’s could clearly 
be recognized as belonging to the latter class. ” Now you 
young — ” (whelp, / think it was, but Edward stoutly 



THE BURGLARS 35 

maintains it was devil), said the curate sternly ; ** tell tu 
what you mean by it ! ” 

“ Well, leggo of my ear then ! ” shrilled Harold, “ and 
m tell you the solemn truth ! ” 

“ Very well,” agreed the curate, releasing him, “ now 
go ahead, and don’t lie more than you can help.” 

We abode the promised disclosure without the least 
misgiving ; but even we had hardly given Harold due credit 
for his fertility of resource and powers of imagination. 

“ 1 had just finished saying my prayers,” began that 
young gentleman slowly, '* when I happened to look out 
of the window, and on the lawn I saw a sight which froze 
the marrow in my veins ! A burglar was approaching the 
house with snake-like tread ! He had a scowl and a dark 
lantern, and he was armed to the teeth ! ” 

We listened with interest. The style, though unlike 
Harold’s native notes, seemed strangely familiar. 

“ Go on,” said the curate grimly. 

“ Pausing in his stealthy career,” continued Harold, 
” he gave a low whistle. Instantly the signal was responded 
to, and from the adjacent shadows two more figures glided 
forth. The miscreants were both armed to the teeth.” 

“ Excellent,” said the curate ; “ proceed.” 

“ The robber chief,” pursued Harold, warming to his 
work, “ joined his nefarious comrades, and conversed with 
them in silent tones. His expression was truly ferocious, 

and I ought to have said that he was armed to the t ” 

“ There, never mind his teeth,” interrupted the curate 
rudely ; “ there’s too much jaw about you altogether. 
Hurry up and have done.” 

“ I was in a fnghtful funk,” continued the narrator, 
warily guarding his ear with his hand, ” but just then the 
drawing-room window opened, and you and Aunt Maria 
came out — 1 mean emerged. The burglars vanished silently 
into the laurels, with horrid implications ! ” 

The curate looked slightly puzzled. The tale was well 
sustained, and certainly circumstantial. After all, the boy 
might really have seen something. How was the poor man 



36 THE BURGLARS 

to know — though the chaste and lofty diction might have 
supplied a hint — that the whole yarn was a free adaptation 
from the last Penny Dreadful lent us by the knife-and-boot 
boy ? 

“ Why did you not alarm the house ? ” he asked. 

“ ’Cos I was afraid,” said Harold sweetly, “ that p’raps 
they mightn’t believe me ! ” 

“ But how did you get down here, you naughty little 
boy ? ” put in Aunt Maria. 

Harold was hard pressed — by his own flesh and blood, 
too ! 

At that moment Edward touched me on the shoulder 
and glided off through the laurels. When some ten yards 
away he gave a low whistle. I replied with another. The 
effect was magical. Aunt Mana started up with a shriek. 
Harold gave one startled glance around, and then fled like 
a hare, made straight for the back-door, burst in upon the 
servants at supper, and buried himself in the broad bosom 
of the cook, his special ally. The curate faced the laurels — 
hesitatingly. But Aunt Maria flung herself on him. “ O 
Mr. Hodgitts ! ” I heard her cry, “ you are brave ! for 
my sake do not be rash ! ” He was not rash. When I 
peeped out a second later the coast was entirely clear. 

By this time there were sounds of a household timidly 
emerging ; and Edward remarked to me that perhaps we 
had better be off. Retreat was an easy matter. A stunted 
laurel gave a leg-up on to the garden wall, which led in its 
turn to the roof of an out-house, up which, at a dubious 
angle, we could crawl to the window of the box-room 
This overland route had been revealed to us one day by 
the domestic cat, when hard pressed in the course of an 
otter-hunt, in which the cat — somewhat unwillingly — ^was 
filhng the title-role ; and it had proved distinctly useful 
on occasions like the present. We were snug in bed — ^minus 
some cuticle from knees and elbows — and Harold, sleepily 
chewing something sticky, had been carried up in the arms 
of the friendly cook, ere the clamour of the burglar-hunters 
had died away. 



THE BURGLARS 


37 

The curate’s undaunted demeanour, as reported by Aunt 
Maria, was generally supposed to have terrified the burglars 
into Sight, and much kudos accrued to him thereby. Some 
days later, however, when he had dropped in to afternoon 
tea, and was making a mild curatorial joke about the moral 
courage required for taking the last piece of bread-and- 
butter, I felt constrained to remark dreamily, and as it 
were to the universe at large : “ Mr. Hodgitts ! you are 
brave ! for my sake do not be rash ! ” 

Fortunately for me, the vicar also was a caller on that 
day ; and it was always a comparatively easy matter to 
dodge my long-coated friend in the open. 



SNOWBOUND 


T welfth-night had come and gone, and life 

next morning seemed a trifle flat and purposeless. 
But yester-cvc, and the mummers were here ! They had 
come striding into the old kitchen, powdering the red brick 
floor with snow from their barbaric bedizenments ; and 
stamping, and crossing, and declaiming, till all was whirl 
and not and shout. Harold was frankly afraid : un- 
abashed, he buried himself in the cook’s ample bosom. 
Edward feigned a manly superiority to illusion, and greeted 
tliese awful apparitions famiharly, as Dick and Harry 
and Joe. As for me, I was too big to run, too rapt to resist 
the magic and surprise. Whence came these outlanders, 
breaking in on us with song and ordered masque and a 
terrible clashing of wooden swords ? And after these, 
what strange visitants might we not look for any quiet 
night, when the chestnuts popped in the ashes, and the 
old ghost stories drew the awestricken circle close? Old 
Merhn, perhaps, “ all furred in black sheep-skins, and a 
russet gown, with a bow and arrows, and bearing wild 
geese in his hand i ” Or stately Ogier the Dane, recalled 
from Faery, asking his way to the land that once had need 
of him ! Or even, on some white night, the Snow-Queen 
herself, with a chime of sleigh-bells and the patter of rein- 
deer’s feet, halting of a sudden at the door flung wide, while 
aloft the Northern Lights went shaking attendant spears 
among the quiet stars ! 

This morning, house-bound by the relentless indefatigable 
snow, I was feeling the reaction. Edward, on the contrary, 
being violendy stage-struck on this his first introduction to 
the real Drama, was striding up and down the floor, pro- 
claiming “ Here be I, King Geaige the Third,” in a strong 



SNOWBOUND 


39 

Berkshire accent. Harold, accustomed, as the youngest, 
to lonely antics and to sports that asked no sympathy, was 
absorbed in “ clubmen ” ; a performance consisting in a 
measured progress round the room arm-in-arm with an 
imaginary companion of reverend years, with occasional 
halts at imaginary clubs, where — ^imaginary steps being 
leisurely ascended — ^imaginary papers were glanced at, 
imaginary scandal was discussed with elderly shakings of 
the head, and — ^regrettable to say — ^imaginary glasses were 
lifted Upwards. Heaven only knows how the germ of this 
dreary pastime first found way into his small-boyish being. 
It was his own invention, and he was proportionately proud 
of it. Meanwhile Charlotte and I, crouched in the window- 
seat, watched, spell-stricken, the whirl and eddy and drive 
of the innumerable snow-flakes, wrapping our cheery 
little world in an uncanny uniform, ghastly in Une and 
hue. 

Charlotte was sadly out of spirits. Having “ countered ” 
Miss Smedley at breakfast, during some argument or other, 
by an apt quotation from her favourite classic (the Fairy 
Book), she had been gently but firmly informed that no such 
things as fames ever reaUy existed. “ Do you mean to say 
it’s all lies ? ” asked Charlotte bluntly. Miss Smedley 
deprecated the use of any such unladylike words in any 
connexion at all. “ These stories had their origin, my dear,” 
she explained, “ in a mistaken anthropomorphism in the 
interpretation of nature. But though we are now too well 
informed to faU into similar errors, there are still many 
beautiful lessons to be learned from these myths ” 

“ But how can you learn anything,” persisted Charlotte, 
“ from what doesn’t exist ? ” And she left the table defiant, 
howbeit depressed. 

“ Don’t you mind her” I said consolingly ; “ how can 
she know anything about it ? Why, she can’t even throw 
a stone properly ! ” 

“ Edward says they’re all rot, too,” replied Charlotte 
doubtfully. 

” Edward says everything’s rot,” I explained, “ now he 



SNOWBOUND 


40 

thinks he’s going into the Army. If a thing’s in a book it 
must be true, so that settles it ! ” 

Charlotte looked almost reassured. The room was quieter 
now, for Edward had got the dragon down and was boring 
holes in him with a purring soimd ; Harold was ascending 
the steps of the Athenaeum with a jaunty air — suggestive 
rather of the Junior Carlton. Outside, the tall elm-tops 
were hardly to be seen through the feathery storm. “ The 
sky’s a-falling,” quoted Charlotte softly ; “ I must go and 
tell the king.” The quotation suggested a fairy story, and 
I offered to read to her, reaching out for the book. But the 
Wee Folk were under a cloud ; sceptical hints had em- 
bittered the chalice. So I was fain to fetch Arthur — second 
favourite with Charlotte for his dames riding errant, and 
an easy first with us boys for his spear-splintering crash of 
tourney and hurtle against hopeless odds. Here again, 
however, I proved unfortunate , what ill-luck made the 
book open at the sorrowful history of Balm and Balan ? 
“ And he vanished anon,” I read : ” and so he heard an 
home blow, as it had been the death of a beast ‘ That 
blast,’ said Bahn, ‘ is blowen for me, for I am the prize, 
and yet am I not dead ’ ” Charlotte began to cry : she 
knew the rest too well. I shut the book in despair. Harold 
emerged from behind the arm-chair. He was sucking his 
thumb (a thing which members of the Reform are seldom 
seen to do), and he stared wide-eyed at his tear-stained 
sister. Edward put off his histrionics, and rushed up to her 
as the consoler — a new part for him. ' 

“ I know a jolly story,” he began. “ Aunt Eliza told it 
me. It was when she was somewhere over in that beastly 
abroad ” — (he had once spent a black month of misery at 
Dinan) — “ and there was a fellow there who had got two 
storks. And one stork died — ^it was the she-stork.” — (“ What 
did it die of? ” put in Harold.) — “ And the other stork 
was quite sorry, and moped, and went on, and got very 
miserable. So they looked about and found a duck, and 
introduced it to the stork. The duck was a drake, but the 
stork didn’t mind, and they loved each other and were as 



SNOWBOUND 41 

jolly as could be. By and by another duck came along — a 
real she-duck this time — and when the drake saw her he 
fell in love, and left the stork, and went and proposed to 
the duck : for she was very beautiful. But the poor stork 
who was left, he said nothing at all to anybody, but Just 
pined and pined and pined away, till one morning he was 
found quite dead : But the ducks lived happily ever after^^ 
wards ! ” 

This was Edward’s idea of a jolly story ! Down again 
went the comers of poor Charlotte’s mouth. Really 
Edward’s stupid inability to see the real point in anything 
was too annoying ! It was always so. Years before, it 
being necessary to prepare his youthful mind for a domestic 
event that might lead to awkward questionings at a time 
when there was little leisure to invent appropriate answers, 
it was delicately inquired of him whether he would like 
to have a httle brother, or perhaps a little sister’* He 
considered the matter carefully in all lU bearings, and finally 
declared for a Newfoundland pup Any boy more “ gleg 
at the uptak ” would have met his parents half-way, and 
e2ised their burden As it was, the matter had to be 
approached all over again from a fresh standpoint. And 
now, while Charlotte turned away sniffingly, with a hiccup 
that told of an overwrought soul, Edward, unconscious 
(like Sir Isaac’s Diamond) of the mischief he had done, 
wheeled round on Harold with a shout. 

“ I want a live dragon,” he announced. “ You’ve got 
to be my dragon ! ” 

“ Leave me go, will you ? ” squealed Harold, struggling 
stoutly. “ I’m playin’ at something else. How can I be a 
dragon and belong to all the clubs ? ” 

“ But wouldn’t you like to be a nice scaly dragon, 
all green,” said Edward, trying persuasion, “ with a 
curly tail and red eyes, and breathing real smoke and 
fire?” 

Harold wavered an instant : Pall-Mall was still strong 
in him. The next he was grovelling on the fioor. No 
saurian ever swung a tail so scaly and so curly as his. Club- 



43 


SNOWBOUND 


land was a thousand yean awav. With homfic pants he 
emitted smokiest smoke and fiercest fire. 

“Now I want a Princess,” cried Edward, clutching 
Charlotte ecstatically ; “ and you can be the Doctor, and 
heal me from the dragon’s deadly wound.” 

Of all professions I held the sacred art of healing in wont 
horror and contempt. Cataclysmal memories of purge and 
draught crowded thick on me, and with Charlotte — ^who 
courted no barren honours — I made a break for the door. 
Edward did likewise, and the hostile forces clashed together 
on the mat, and for a brief space things were mixed and 
chaotic and Arthurian. The silvery sound of the luncheon- 
bell restored an instant peace, even in the teeth of clenched 
antagonisms like ours. The Holy GraU itself, “ sliding 
athwart a sunbeam,” never so effectually stilled a riot of 
warring passions into sweet and quiet accord. 



WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT 


E dward was standing gingcr-bcer like a gentleman, 
happening, as the one that had last passed under the 
dentist’s hands, to be the capitalist of the flying hour. As 
in all well-regulated families, the usual tariff obtained in 
ours : half a crown a tooth ; one shilling only if the molar 
were a loose one. This one, unfortunately — ^in spite of 
Edward’s interested affectation of agony — had been shaki- 
ness undisguised ; but the event was good enough to run 
to ginger-beer. As financier, however, Edward had claimed 
exemption from any servile duties of procurement, and had 
swaggered about the garden while I fetched from the village 
post-office, and Harold stole a tumbler from the pantry. 
Our preparations complete, we were sprawling on the 
lawn ; the staidest and most self-respecting of the rabbits 
had been let loose to grace the feast, and was lopping 
demurely about the grass, selecting the juiciest plantains ; 
while Selina, as the eldest lady present, was toying, in her 
affected feminine way, with the first full tumbler, daintily 
fishing for bits of broken cork. 

“ Hurry up, can’t you ? ” growled our host ; “ what 
are you girls always so beastly particular for ? ” 

“ Martha says,” explained Harold (thirsty too, but still 
just), “ that if you swallow a bit of cork, it swells, and it 

swells, and it swells inside you, till you ” 

“ O bosh ! ” said Edward, draining the glass with a fine 
pretence of indifference to consequences, but all the same 
(as I noticed) dodging the floating cork-fragments with skill 
and judgment. 

“ O, it’s all very well to say bosh,” replied Harold 
nettled : “ but every one knows it’s true but you. Why, 
when Uncle Thomas was here last, and they got up a bottle 

43 



WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT 


44 

of wine for him, he took just one tiny sip out of his glass, 
and then he said, “ Poo, my goodness, that’s corked ! ” 
And he wouldn’t touch it. And they had to get a fresh 
bottle up. The funny part was, though, I looked in his glass 
afterwards, when it was brought out into the passage, and 
there wasn’t any cork in it at all ! So I drank it all off, 
and it was very good ! ” 

“ You’d better be careful, young man ! ” said his elder 
brother, regarding him severely. “ D’you remember that 
night when the Mummers were here, and they had mulled 
port, and you went round and emptied all the glasses after 
they had gone away ^ ” 

“ Ow ! I did feel funny that night,” chuckled Harold. 
“ Thought the house was cornin’ down, it jumped about so : 
and Martha had to carry me up to bed, ’cos the stairs was 
goin’ all waggity ! ” 

We gazed scarchingly at our graceless junior ; but it 
was clear that he viewed the matter in the light of a phe- 
nomenon rather than of a delinquency. 

A third bottle was by this time circling ; and Selma, 
who had evidently waited for it to reach her, took a most 
unfairly long pull, and then, jumping up and shaking out 
her frock, announced tliat she was going for a walk. Then 
she fled like a hare , for it was the custom of our Family 
to meet with physical coercion any independence of action 
in individuals. 

“ She’s off with those Vicarage girls again,” said Edward, 
regarding Selina’s long black legs twinkling down the path. 
“ She goes out with them every day now ; and as soon as 
ever they start, all their heads go together and they chatter, 
chatter, chatter the whole blessed time ! I can’t make out 
what they find to talk about. They never stop ; it’s gabble, 
gabble, gabble right along, like a nest of young rooks ! ” 

“ P’raps they talk about birds’-eggs,” I suggested sleepily 
(the sun was hot, the turf soft, the ginger-beer potent) ; 
“ and about ships, and buffaloes, and desert islands ; 
and why rabbits have white tails ; and whether they’d 
sooner have a schooner or a cutter ; and what they’ll 



WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT 45 

be when they’re men — at least, I mean there’s lots of things 
to talk about, if you want to talk.” 

“ Yes ; but they don’t talk about those sort of things at 
all,” persisted Edward. “ How can they ? They don’t 
know anything ; they can’t do anything — except play the 
piano, and nobody would want to talk about that ; and 
they don’t care about anything — anything sensible, I mean. 
So what do they talk about ? ’ 

” I asked Martha once,” put in Harold ; “ and she said, 
‘ Never you mind ; young ladies has lots of things to talk 
about that young gentlemen can’t understand ’ ” 

“ I don’t believe it,” Edward growled 
“ Well, that’s what she said, anyway,” rejoined Harold 
indifferendy The subject did not seem to him of first-class 
importance, and it was hindering the circulation of the 
ginger-beer. 

We heard the click of the front-gate. Through a gap in 
the hedge we could see the party setting off down the road. 
Schna was in the middle ; a Vicarage girl had her by cither 
arm ; their heads were together, as Edward had described ; 
and the clack of their tongues came down the breeze like 
the busy pipe of starlings on a bright March morning. 

“ What do they talk about, Charlotte ^ ” I inquired, 
wishing to pacify Edward “ You go out with them 
sometimes.” 

“ I don’t know,” said poor Charlotte dolefully “ They 
make me walk behind, ’cos they say I’m too little, and 
mustn’t hear. And I do want to so,” she added. 

“ When any lady comes to see Aunt Eliza,” said Harold, 
“ they both talk at once all the time. And yet each of ’em 
seems to hear what the other one’s saying. I can’t make out 
how they do it. Grown-up people are so clever ! ” 

“ The Curate’s the funniest man,” I remarked. “ He’s 
always saying things that have no sense in them at all, and 
then laughing at them as if they were jokes. Yesterday, 
when they asked him if he’d have some more tea, he said, 
* Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,’ 
and then sniggered all over. I didn’t see anything funny 



46 WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT 

in that. And then somebody asked him about his button- 
hole, and he said, * ’Tis but a little faded flower,* and ex- 
ploded again. I thought it very stupid.” 

” O Ann,” said Edward contemptuously : ” he can’t 
help it, you know ; it’s a sort of way he’s got. But it’s 
these girls I can’t make out. If they’ve anything really 
sensible to talk about, how is it nobody knows what it is ? 
And if they haven’t — and we know they cm't have, naturally 
— ^why don’t they shut up their jaw ? This old rabbit here 
— he doesn’t want to talk. He’s got something better to do.” 
And Edward aimed a gingcr-bccr cork at the unruffled 
beast, who never budged. 

” O but rabbits do talk,” interposed Harold. “ I’v'e 
watched them often in their hutch. They put their heads 
together and their noses go up and down, just like Selma’s 
and the Vicarage girls’. Only of course I can’t hear what 
they’re sayii^g.” 

” Well, if they do,” said Edward unwillingly, ” I’ll 
bet they don’t talk such rot as those girls do ! ” Which 
was ungenerous, as well as unfair ; for it had not yet trans- 
pired — nor has it to this day — what Selina and her friends 
talked about. 



THE ARGONAUTS. 


T he advent of strangers, of whatever sort, into our 
circle had always been a matter of grave dubiety 
and suspicion. Indeed, it was generally a signal for retreat 
into caves and fastnesses of the earth, into unthreaded 
copses or remote oudying cowsheds, whence we were only 
to be extricated by wily nursemaids, rendered familiar by 
experience with our secret runs and refuges. It was not 
surprising, therefore, that the heroes of classic legend, when 
first we made their acquaintance, failed to win our entire 
sympathy at once, “ Confidence,” says somebody, “ is a 
plant of slow growth ” ; and these stately dark-haired 
demi-gods, with names hard to master and strange accoutre- 
ments, had to win a citadel already strongly garrisoned with 
a more familiar soldiery. Their chill foreign goddesses 
had no such direct appeal for us as the mocking malicious 
fairies and witches of the North. Wc missed the pleasant 
alliance of the animal — the fox who spread the bushiest of 
tails to convey us to the enchanted castle, the frog in the 
well, the raven who croaked advice from the tree ; and — 
to Harold especially — it seemed entirely wrong that the 
hero should ever be other than the youngest brother of 
three. This belief, indeed, in the special fortune that ever 
awaited the youngest brother, as such, — the “ Borough- 
English ” of Faery, — had been of baleful effect on Harold, 
producing a certain self-conceit and perkiness that called 
for physical correction. But even in our admonishment we 
were on his side ; and as we distrustfully eyed these new 
arrivals, old Saturn himself seemed something of a parvenu. 
Even strangers, however, if they be good fellows at heart, 
may develop into sworn comrades ; and these gay swords- 
men, after all, were of the right stuff Perseus, with his 

47

cap of darkness and his wonderful sandals, was not long 
in winging his way to our hearts. Apollo knocked at 
Admetus’ gate in something of the right fairy fashion. 
Psyche brought with her an orthodox palace of magic, as 
well as helpful birds and friendly ants. Ulysses, with his 
captivating shifts and strategies, broke down the final 
barrier, and henceforth the band was adopted and admitted 
into our freemasonry. 

I had been engaged in chasing Farmer Larkin’s calves — 
his special pride — round the field, just to show the man we 
hadn’t forgotten him, and was returning through the 
kitchen-garden with a conscience at peace with all men, 
when I happened upon Edward, grubbing for worms in the 
dung-heap Edward put his worms into his hat and we 
Strolled along together, discussing high matters of state. 
As we reached the tool-shed, strange noises arrested our 
steps ; looking in, we perceived Harold, alone, rapt, 
absorbed, immersed in the special game of the moment. 
He was squatting in an old pig- trough that had been brought 
in to be tinkered ; and as he rhapsodized, anon he waved 
a shovel over his head, anon dug it into the ground with the 
action of those who would urge Canadian canoes. Edward 
strode in upon him. 

“ What rot are you playing at now ^ ” he demanded 
sternly. 

Harold flushed up, but stuck to his pig-trough like a man. 
“ I’m Jason,” he replied defiantly ; “ and this is the Argo. 
The other fellows are here too, only you can’t sec them ; 
and we’re just going through the Hellespont, so don’t you 
come bothering.” And once more he plied the wine-dark 
sea. 

Edward kicked the pig- trough contemptuously. “ Pretty 
sort of Argo you’ve got ! ” said he. 

Harold began to get annoyed. “ I can’t help it,” he 
retorted. “ It’s the best sort of Argo I can manage, and 
it’s all right if you only pretend enough. But jou never 
could pretend one bit.” 

Edward reflected. “ Look here,” he said presently. 



THE ARGONAUTS 


49 

“ Why shouldn’t we get hold of Farmer Larkin’s boat, and 
go right away up the river in a real Argo, and look for 
Medea, and the Golden Fleece, and everything ? And I’ll 
tell you what, I don’t mind your being Jason, as you thought 
of it first.” 

Harold tumbled out of the trough in the excess of his 
emotion. “ But we aren’t allowed to go on the water by 
ourselves,” he cried. 

” No,” said Edward, with fine scorn : “ we aren’t 
allowed ; and Jason wasn’t allowed either, I daresay. 
But he went ' ” 

Harold’s protest had been merely conventional : he 
only wanted to be convinced by sound argument. The 
next question was. How about the girls ? Selma was 
distinctly handy in a boat * the difficulty about her was, 
that if she disapproved of the expedition — and, morally 
considered, it was not exactly a Pilgrim’s Progress — she 
might go and tell ; she having just reached that disagree- 
able age when one begins to develop a conscience. Char- 
lotte, for her part, had a habit of day-dreams, and was as 
likely as not to fall overboard in one of her rapt musings. 
To be sure, she would dissolve in tears when she found her- 
self left out ; but even that was better than a watery tomb. 
In fine, the public voice — and rightly, perhaps — ^was against 
the admission of the skirted animal ' despite the precedent 
of Atalanta, who was one of the original crew. 

“ And now,” said Edward, “ who’s to ask Farmer 
Larkin ? / can’t ; last time I saw him he said when he 
caught me again he’d smack my head Tou’// have to.” 

I hesitated, for good reasons. “ You know those precious 
calves of his ? ” I began. 

Edward understood at once. “ All right,” he said ; 
“ then we won’t ask him at all It doesn’t much matter. 
He’d only be annoyed, and that would be a pity. Now 
let’s set off” 

We made our way down to the stream, and captured the 
farmer’s boat without let or hindrance, the enemy being 
engaged in the hayfields. This “ river,” so called, could 
4 



THE ARGONAUTS 


50 

never be discovered by us in any atlas ; indeed, our Argo 
could hardly turn in it without risk of shipwreck. But to 
us ’twas Orinoco, and the cities of the world dotted its 
shores. We put the Argo’s head upstream, since that led 
away from the Larkin province ; Harold was faithfully 
permitted to be Jason, and we shared the rest of the heroes 
among us. Then, quitting Thessaly, we threaded the 
Hellespont with shouts, breathlessly dodged the Clashing 
Rocks, and coasted under the lee of the Siren-haunted isles. 
Lemnos was fringed with meadow-sweet, dog-roses dotted 
the Mysian shore, and the cheery call of the haymaking 
folk sounded along the coast of Thrace 

After some hour or two’s seafaring, the prow of the Argo 
embedded itself in the mud of a landing-place, plashy with 
the tread of cows and giving on to a lane that led towards 
the smoke of human habitations Edward jumped ashore, 
alert for exploration, and strode off without waiting to see if 
we followed ; but I lingered behind, having caught sight 
of a moss-grown water-gate hard by, leading into a garden 
that, from the brooding quiet lapping it round, appeared 
to portend magical possibilities 

Indeed, the very air within seemed stiller, as we circum- 
spectly passed through the gate , and Harold hung back 
shamefaced, as if we were crossing the threshold of some 
private chamber, and ghosts of old days were hustling past 
us. Flowers there were, everywhere ; but they drooped 
and sprawled in an overgrowth hinting at indifference ; 
the scent of heliotrope possessed the place as if actually 
hung in solid festoons from tall untrimmed hedge to hedge. 
No basket-chairs, shawls, or novels dotted the lawn with 
colour , and on the garden-front of the house behind, the 
blinds were mostly drawn A grey old sun-dial dominated 
the central sward, and we moved towards it instinctively, 
as the most human thing in sight. An antick motto ran 
round it, and with eyes and fingers we struggled at the 
decipherment. 

TIME • TRYETH • TROTHE ; Spelt out Harold at last, 
“ I wonder what that means ? ” 



THE ARGONAUTS 


51 

I could not enlighten him, nor meet his further questions 
as to the inner mechanism of the thing, and where you 
wound it up. I had seen these instruments before, of 
course ; but had never fully understood their manner of 
working. 

We were still puzzling our heads over the contrivance, 
when I became aware that Medea herself was moving down 
the path from the house. Dark-haired, supple, of a figure 
lightly poised and swayed, but pale and hstless — I knew her 
at once, and having come out to find her, naturally felt 
no surprise at all. But Harold, who was trying to chmb on 
to the top of the sun-dial, having a cat-like fondness for the 
summit of things, started and fell prone, barking his chin 
and filling the pleasance with lamentation 

Medea skimmed the ground swallow-like, and in a 
moment was on her knees comforting him, wiping the dirt 
out of his chin with her own dainty handkerchief, and 
vocal with soft murmur of consolation 

“ You needn’t take on so about him,” I observed 
politely. “ He’ll cry for just one minute, and then he’ll 
be all right.” 

My estimate was justified At the end of his regulation 
time Harold stopped crying suddenly, like a clock that had 
struck its hour ; and with a serene and cheerful counten- 
ance wriggled out of Medea’s embrace, and ran for a stone 
to throw at an intrusive blackbird. 

“ O you boys ! ” cried Medea, throwing wide her arms 
with abandonment “ Where have you dropped from 
How dirty you are ! I’ve been shut up here for a thousand 
years, and all that time I’ve never seen anyone under a 
hundred and fifty ' Let’s play at something, at once ! ” 

“ Rounders is a good game,” I suggested “ Girls can 
play at rounders. And we could serve up to the sun-dial 
here But you want a bat and a ball, and some more 
people.” 

She struck her hands together tragically. “ I haven’t a 
bat,” she cried, “ or a ball, or more people, or anything 
sensible whatever. Never mind ; let’s play at hide-and- 



58 THE ARGONAUTS 

seek in the kitchen-garden. And we’ll race there, up to 
that walnut-tree ; I haven’t run for a century ! ” 

She was so easy a victor, nevertheless, that I began to 
doubt, as I panted behind, whether she had not exaggerated 
her age by a year or two. She flung herself into hide-and- 
seek with all the gusto and abandonment of the true artist ; 
and as she flitted away and reappeared, flushed and laugh- 
ing divinely, the pale witch-maiden seemed to fall away 
from her, and she moved rather as that other girl I had read 
about, snatched from fields of daffodil to reign in shadow 
below, yet permitted now and again to revisit earth and 
light and the frank, caressing air. 

Tired at last, we strolled back to the old sun-dial, and 
Harold, who never relinquished a problem unsolved, 
began afresh, rubbing his finger along the faint incisions. 
“ Time tryeth Irothe. Please, I want to know what that 
means ^ ” 

Medea’s face dropped low over the sun-dial, till it was 
almost hidden in her fingers “ That’s what I’m here for,” 
she said presently in quite a changed, low voice. “ They 
shut me up here — they think I’ll forget — but I never will — 
never, never ! And he, too — but I don’t know — it is so 
long — I don’t know ' ” 

Her face was quite hidden now There was silence again 
in the old garden. I felt clumsily helpless and awkward. 
Beyond a vague idea of kicking Harold, nothing remedial 
seemed to suggest itself. 

None of us had noticed the approach of another she- 
creature — one of the angular and rigid class — ^how different 
from our dear comrade ' The years Medea had rlaiirn^ 
might well have belonged to her ; she wore mittens, too — 
a trick I detested in woman. “ Lucy ' ” she said sharply, 
in a tone with aunt writ large over it ; and Medea started 
up guiltily. 

“ You’ve been crying,” said the newcomer, gr iml y 
regarding her through spectacles “ And pray who are 
these exceedingly dirty little boys ? ” 

“ Friends of mine, aunt,” said Medea promptly, with 



THE ARGONAUTS 


53 

forced cheerfulness. *' I — I’ve known them a long time. 
I asked them to come.” 

The aunt sniffed suspiciously. “ You must come indoors, 
dear,” she said, “ and lie down. The sun will give you a 
headache. And you little boys had better run away home 
to your tea. Remember, you should not come to pay visits 
without your nursemaid.” 

Harold had been tugging nervously at my jacket for 
some time, and I only waited tiU Medea turned and kissed 
a white hand to us as she was led away. Then I ran. We 
gained the boat in safety ; and “ What an old dragon ! ” 
said Harold. * 

“ Wasn’t she a beast ! ” I replied “ Fancy the sun 
giving anyone a headache ! But Medea was a real brick. 
Couldn’t we carry her off? ” 

“ We could if Edward was here,” said Harold confidently. 
The question was, What had become of that defaulting 
hero ? We were not left long in doubt. First, there came 
down the lane the shrill and wrathful clamour of a female 
tongue ; then Edward, running his best ; and then an 
excited woman hard on his heel. Edwaid tumbled into 
the bottom of the boat, gasping ” Shove her off ! ” And 
shove her off we did, mightily, while the dame abused us 
from the bank in the self-same accents in which Alfred 
hurled defiance at the marauding Dane. 

” That was just like a bit out of Westward Ho ! ” I 
remarked approvingly, ar we sculled down the stream. 
“ But what had you been doing to her ^ ” 

” Hadn’t been doing anything,” panted Edward, still 
breathless. “ I went up into the village and explored, and 
it was a very nice one, and the people were very polite. 
And there was a blacksmith’s forge there, and they were 
shoeing horses, and hoofs fizzled and smoked, and smelt so 
jolly ! I stayed there quite a long time. Then I got thirsty, 
so I asked that old woman for some water, and while she 
was getting it her cat came out of the cottage, and looked 
at me in a nasty sort of way, and said something I didn’t 
like. So 1 went up to it just to — to teach it manners, and 



54 THE ARGONAUTS 

somehow or other, next minute it was up an apple-tree, 
spitting, and I was running down the lane with that old 
thing ^ter me.” 

Edward was so full of his personal injuries that there was 
no interesting him in Medea at all. Moreover, the evening 
was closing in, and it was evident that this cutting-out 
expedition must be kept for another day. As we neared 
home, it gradually occurred to us that perhaps the greatest 
danger was yet to come ‘ for the farmer must have missed 
his boat ere now, and would probably be lying in wait for 
us near the landing-place. There was no other spot admit- 
ting of debarcation on the home side ; if we got out on the 
other and made for the bridge, we should certainly be seen 
and cut olf Then it was that I blessed my stars that our 
elder brother was with us tliat day. He might be little good 
at pretending, but in grapphng with the stern facts of 
life he had no equal Enjoining silence, he waited till we 
were but a little way from the fated landing-place, and then 
brought us in to the opposite bank We scrambled out 
noiselessly and — the gathering darkness favouring us — 
crouched behind a willow, while Edward pushed off the 
empty boat with his foot The old Argo, borne down by the 
gentle current, slid and grazed along the rushy bank ; 
and when she came opposite the suspected ambush, a 
stream of imprecation told us that our precaution had not 
been wasted We wondered, as we listened, where Farmer 
Larkin, who was bucohcally bred and reared, had acquired 
such range and wealth of vocabulary. Fully realizing at 
last that his boat was derelict, abandoned, at the mercy of 
wind and wave — as well as out of his reach — he strode away 
to the bridge, about a quarter of a mile further down ; 
and as soon as we heard his boots clumping on the planks 
we nipped out, recovered the craft, pulled across, and 
made the faithful vessel fast to her proper moorings. 
Edward was anxious to wait and exchange courtesies and 
compliments with the disappointed farmer, when he 
should confront us on the opposite bank ; but wiser counsels 
prevailed. It was possible that the piracy was not yet laid 



THE ARGONAUTS

at our particular door : Ulysses, I reminded him, had 
reason to regret a similar act of bravado, and — ^were he 
here — ^would certainly advise a timely retreat. Edward 
held but a low opinion of me as a counsellor ; but he had a 
very solid respect for Ulysses, 



THE ROMAN ROAD 


A ll the roads of our neighbourhood were cheerful 
and friendly, having each of them pleasant qualities 
of their own , but this one seemed different from the others 
in its masterful suggestion of a serious purpose, speeding 
you along with a strange uplifting of the heart. The others 
tempted chiefly with their treasures of hedge and ditch ; 
the rapt surprise of the first lords-and-ladies, the rustle 
of a field-mouse, the splash of a frog ; while cool noses of 
brother-beasts were pushed at you through gate or gap. 
A loiterer you had need to be, did you choose one of them ; 
so many were the tiny hands thrust out to detain you, 
from this side and that. But this one was of a sterner sort, 
and even in its shedding off of bank and hedgerow as it 
marched straight and full for the open downs, it seemed to 
declare its contempt for adventitious trappings to catch the 
shallow-pated. When the sense of injustice or disappoint- 
ment was heavy on me, and things were very black within, 
as on this particular day, the road of character was my 
choice for tliat solitary ramble when I turned my back for 
an afternoon on a world that had unaccountably declared 
itself against me. 

“ The Knights’ Road ” we children had named it, from 
a sort of feeling that, if from any quarter at all, it would be 
down this track we might some day see Lancelot and his 
peers come pacing on their great war-horses ; supposing 
that any of the stout band still survived, in nooks and un- 
explored places. Grown-up people sometimes spoke of it 
as the “ Pilgrims’ Way ’’ ; but I didn’t know much about 
pilgrims — except Walter in the Horselberg story. Him 
I sometimes saw breaking with haggard eyes out of yonder 
copse, and calling to the pilgrims as they hurried along on 

56 



THE ROMAN ROAD 


57 


their desperate march to the Holy City, where peace and 
pardon were awaiting them. “ All roads lead to Rome,” 
I had once heard somebody say ; and I had taken the 
remark very seriously, of course, and puzzled over it many 
days. There must have been some mistake, I concluded 
at last ; but of one road at least I intuitively felt it to be true. 
And my belief was clinched by something that fell from Miss 
Smedley during a history-lesson, about a strange road that 
ran right down the middle of England till it reached the 
coast, and then began again in France, just opposite, and 
so on undeviating, through city and vineyard, right from 
the misty Highlands to the Eternal City. Uncorroborated, 
any statement of Miss Smedley’s usually fell on incredulous 
ears ; but here, with the road itself in evidence she seemed, 
once in a way, to have strayed into truth 

Rome ! It was fascinating to think that it lay at the 
other end of this white ribbon that rolled itself off from my 
feet over the distant downs I was not quite so uninstructed 
as to imagine I could reach it that afternoon ; but some 
day, I thought, if things went on being as unpleasant as 
they were now — some day, when Aunt Eliza had gone on a 
visit, — some day, we would see. 

I tried to imagine what it would be like when I got there. 
The Coliseum I knew, of course, from a woodcut in the 
history-book : so to begin with I plumped that down in the 
middle. The rest had to be patched up from the little grey 
market-town where twice a year we went to have our hair 
cut ; hence, in the result, Vespasian’s amphitheatre was 
approached by muddy little streets, wherein the Red Lion 
and the Blue Boar, with Somebody’s Entire along their 
front, and “ Commercial Room ” on their windows ; the 
doctor’s house, of substantial red-brick ; and the facade 
of the New Wesleyan chapel, which we thought very fine, 
were the chief architectural ornaments : while the Roman 
populace pottered about in smocks and corduroys, twisting 
the tails of Roman calves and inviting each other to beer in 
musical Wessex. From Rome I drifted on to other cities, 
faintly heard of — ^Damascus, Brighton (Aunt Eliza’s ideal). 



THE ROMAN ROAD 


58 

Athens, and Glasgow, whose glories the gardener sang ; 
but there was a certain sameness in my conception of all 
of them : that Wesleyan chapel would keep cropping up 
everywhere. It was easier to go a-building among those 
dream-cities where no limitations were imposed, and one 
was sole architect, with a free hand. Down a delectable 
street of cloud-built palaces I was mentally pacing, when I 
happened upon the Artist. 

He was seated at work by the roadside, at a point whence 
the cool large spaces of the downs, juniper-studded, swept 
grandly westwards. His attributes proclaimed him of the 
artist tribe • besides, he wore kmckerbockers like myself, — 
a garb confined, I was aware, to boys and artists. I knew 
I was not to bother him with questions, nor look over his 
shoulder and breathe in his ear — they didn’t like it, this 
genus mitabtle. But there was nothing about staring in my 
code of instructions, the point having somehow been over- 
looked . so, squatting down on the grass, I devoted myself 
to the passionate absorbing of every detail. At the end of 
five minutes there was not a button on him that I could not 
have passed an examination in ; and the wearer himself 
of that homespun suit was probably less familiar with its 
pattern and texture than I was. Once he looked up, 
nodded, half held out his tobacco pouch, mechanically 
as It were, then, returning it to his pocket, resumed his 
work, and I my mental photography. 

After another five minutes or so had passed, he remarked, 
without looking my way “ Fine afternoon we’re ha ving ; 
going far to-day ^ ” 

“ No, I’m not going any farther than this,” I replied ; 
“ I was thinking of going on to Rome . but I’ve put it off.” 

“ Pleasant place, Rome,” he murmured : “ you’ll 

like It ” It was some minutes later that he added : “ But 
I wouldn’t go just now, if I were you : too jolly hot.” 

“ You haven’t been to Rome, have you ’ ” I inquired. 

“ Rather,” he replied briefly • “ I live there ” 

This was too much, and my jaw dropped as I struggled to 
grasp the fact that 1 was sitting there talking to a fellow who 



THE ROMAN ROAD 59 

lived in Rome. Speech was out of the question : besides 
I had other things to do. Ten solid minutes had I already 
spent in an examination of him as a mere stranger and 
artist ; and now the whole thing had to be done over again, 
from the changed point of view. So I began afresh, at the 
crown of his soft hat, and worked down to his sohd British 
shoes, this time investing everything with the new Roman 
halo ; and at last I managed to get out : “ But you don’t 
really live there, do you ? ” never doubting the fact, but 
wanting to hear it repeated. 

“ Well,” he said, good-naturedly overlooking the slight 
rudeness of my query, “ I hve there as much as I live 
anywhere. About half the year sometimes. I’ve got a sort 
of a shanty there. You must come and see it some day.” 

“ But do you live anywhere else as well ? ” I went on, 
feeling the forbidden tide of questions surging up within 
me. 

” O yes, all over the place,” was his vague reply. “ And 
I’ve got a diggings somewhere off Piccadilly.” 

” Where’s that I inquired. 

“ Where’s what ? ” said he. “ O, Piccadilly ! It’s in 
London.” 

” Have you a large garden ? ” I asked ; “ and how 
many pigs have you got ? ” 

” I’ve got no garden at all,” he replied sadly, “ and 
they don’t allow me to keep pigs, though I’d hke to, awfully. 
It’s very hard.” 

” But what do you do all day, then,” I cried, “ and where 
do you go and play, without any garden, or pigs, or 
things ? ” 

“ When I want to play,” he said gravely, “ I have to go 
and play in the street j but it’s poor fun, I grant you. 
There’s a goat, though, not far off and sometimes I talk 
to him when I’m feeling lonely ; but he’s very proud.” 

” Goats are proud,” I admitted. “ There’s one lives 
near here, and if you say anything to him at all, he hits 
you in the wind with his head. You know what it feels 
like when a fellow hits you in the wind ? ”

work, and 1 my mental photography. 

After another five minutes or so had passed, he remarked, 
without looking my way . “ Tine afternoon we’re having ; 
going far to-day ? ” 

“ No, I’m not going any farther than this,” I replied ; 
“ I was thinking of going on to Rome : but I’ve put it ofiF.” 

” Pleasant place, Rome,” he murmured : “ you’ll 

like It ” It was some minutes later that he added : “ But 
I wouldn’t go just now, if I were you ; too jolly hot.” 

Tou haven’t been to Rome, have you ? ” I inquired. 

“ Rather,” he replied briefly . “ I hve there.” 

This was too much, and my jaw dropped as I struggled to 
grasp the fact that I was sitting there talking to a fellow who 



THE ROMAN ROAD 59 

lived in Rome. Speech was out of the question : besides 
I had other things to do. Ten solid minutes had I already 
spent in an examination of him as a mere stranger and 
artist ; and now the whole thing had to be done over again, 
from the changed point of view. So 1 began afresh, at the 
crown of his soft hat, and worked down to his solid British 
shoes, this time investing everything with the new Roman 
halo ; and at last I managed to get out - “ But you don’t 
really live there, do you ? ” never doubting the fact, but 
wanting to hear it repeated. 

“ Well,” he said, good-naturedly overlooking the slight 
rudeness of my query, “ I live there as much as I live 
anywhere. About half the year sometimes. I’ve got a sort 
of a shanty there You must come and see it some day.” 

“ But do you live anywhere else as well ? ” I went on, 
feeling the forbidden tide of questions surging up within 
me. 

“ O yes, all over the place,” was his vague reply. “ And 
I’ve got a diggings somewhere off Piccadilly.” 

“ Where’s that ? ” I inquired. 

“ Where’s what ? ” said he. “ O, Piccadilly I It’s in 
London ” 

“ Have you a large garden ? ” I asked ; “ and how 
many pigs have you got ^ ” 

“ I’ve got nc garden at all,” he replied sadly, “ and 
they don’t allow me to keep pigs, though I’d like to, awfully. 
It’s very hard.” 

“ But what do you do all day, then,” I cried, “ and where 
do you go and play, witliout any garden, or pigs, or 
things ? ” 

“ When I want to play,” he said gravely, “ I have to go 
and play in the street ; but it’s poor fun, I grant you. 
There’s a goat, though, not far off and sometimes I talk 
to him when I’m feeling lonely ; but he’s very proud.” 

“ Goats are proud,” I admitted. ” There’s one lives 
near here, and if you say anything to him at all, he hits 
you in the wind with his head. You know what it feels 
like when a fellow hits you in the wind ? ” 



6o THE ROMAN ROAD 

“ I do, well,” he replied, in a tone of proper melancholy, 
and painted on. 

“ And have you been to any other places,” I began again 
presently, “ besides Rome and Kccy-what’s-his-name ? ” 

“ Heaps,” he said. “ I’m a sort of Ulysses — seen men 
and cities, you know In fact, about the only place I never 
got to was the Fortunate Island.” 

I began to like this man. He answered your questions 
briefly and to the point, and never tried to be funny. I felt 
I could be confidential with him 

“ Wouldn’t you like,” I inquired, “ to find a city without 
any people in it at all ? ” 

He looked puzzled. “ I’m afraid I don’t quite under- 
stand,” said he 

” I mean,” I went on eagerly, “ a city where you walk 
in at the gates, and the shops are all full of beautiful things, 
and the houses furnished as grand as can be, and there 
isn’t anybody there whatever ’ And you go into the shops, 
and take anything you want — chocolates and magic- 
lanterns and injirubber balls — and there’s nothing to pay ; 
and you choose your own house and live there and do just 
as you like, and never go to bed unless you want to ! ” 

The artist laid down his brush. “ That would be a nice 
city,” he said “ Better than Rome. You can’t do that 
sort of thing in Rome — or in Piccadilly either. But I fear 
it’s one of the places I’ve never been to.” 

“ And you’d ask your friends,” I went on, warming to 
my subject ; “ only those you really like, of course ; and 
they’d each have a house to themselves — there’d be lots of 
houses, — and there wouldn’t be any relations at all, unless 
they promised they’d be pleasant ; and if they weren’t 
they’d have to go.” 

“ So you wouldn’t have any relations ? ” said the artist. 
” Well, perhaps you’re right. We have tastes in common, 
I see.” 

“ I’d have Harold,” I said reflectively, “ and Charlotte. 
They’d like it awfully. The others are getdng too old. 
O, and Martha— I’d have Martha to cook and wash up 



THE ROMAN ROAD 6i 

and do things. You’d like Martha. She’s ever so much 
nicer than Aunt Eliza. She’s my idea of a real lady.” 

“ Then I’m sure I should like her,” he replied heartily, 
” and when I come to — ^what do you call this city of yours ? 
Nephelo — something, did you say ? ” 

“ I — I don’t know,” I replied timidly. “ I’m afraid it 
hasn’t got a name — yet.” 

The artist gazed out over the downs. “ ‘ The jxict says, 
dear city of Cecrops,’ ” he said softly to himself, ” ‘ and 
wilt not thou say, dear city of Zeus ? ’ That’s from Marcus 
Aurelius,” he went on, turning again to his work. “ You 
don’t know him, I suppose ; you will some day.” 

“ Who’s he ? ” I inquired. 

“ O, just another fellow who lived in Rome,” he replied, 
dabbing away. 

“ O dear ! ” I cried disconsolately. “ What a lot of 
people seem to live at Rome, and I’ve never even been 
there ! But I think I’d like my city best.” 

” And so would I,” he replied with unction. “ But 
Marcus Aurelius wouldn’t, you know ” 

“ Then we won’t invite him,” I said ; *' will we ^ ” 

“ / won’t if you won’t,” said he And that point being 
settled, we were silent for a while. 

“ Do you know,” he said presently, “ I’ve met one or two 
fellows from lime to time, who have been to a city like 
yours — perhaps it was the same one They won’t talk much 
about It — only broken hints, now and then ; but they’ve 
been there sure enough They don’t seem to care about 
anything in particular — and everything’s the same to them, 
rough or smooth ; and sooner or later they slip off and 
disappear ; and you never see them again. Gone back, I 
suppose.” 

“ Of course,” said I. “ Don’t see what they ever came 
away for , I wouldn’t. To be told you’ve broken things 
when you haven’t, and stopped having tea with the servants 
in the kitchen, and not allowed to have a dog to sleep with 
you. But I’oe known people, too, who’ve gone there.” 

The artist stared, but without incivility. 



62 


THE ROMAN ROAD 


“ Well, there’s Lancelot,” I went on. “ The book says he 
died, but it never seemed to read right, somehow. He just 
went away, like Arthur. And Crusoe, when he got tired 
of wearing clothes and being respectable. And all the nice 
men in the stones who don’t marry the Princess, ’cos only 
one man ever gets married in a book, you know. They’ll 
be there ' ” 

“ And the men who never come off,” he said, “ who try 
like the rest, but get knocked out, or somehow miss — or 
break down or get bowled over in the melee — and get no 
Princess, nor even a second-class kingdom — some of them’ll 
he there, I hope ^ ” 

“ Yes, if you like,” I replied, not quite understanding 
him , “ if they’re friends of yours, we’ll ask ’em, of course ” 

“ What a time we shall have • ” said the artist reflec- 
tively , ” and how shocked old Marcus Aurelius will be ' ” 

The shadows had lengthened uncannily, a tide of golden 
haze was flooding the grey-green surface of the downs, and 
the artist began to put his traps together, preparatory to a 
move I felt very low we would have to part, it seemed, 
pist as we were getting on so well together Then he stood 
up, and he isas very straight and tall, and the sunset was 
in his hair and beard as he stood there, high over me. He 
took my hand like an equal “ Tve enjoyed our conversa- 
tion very much,” he said “ That was an interesting subject 
you started, and we haven't half exhausted it. We shall 
meet again, I hope •’ ” 

“ Of course we shall,” I leplied, surprised that there 
should be any doubt about it 

“ In Rome perhaps ? ” said he. 

“ Yes, in Rome,” I answered , “ or Piccy-the-other- 
p’ ice, or somewhere.” 

“ Or else,” said he, “ in that other city — when we’ve 
found the way there. And I’ll look out for you, and you’ll 
sing out as soon as you see me. And we’ll go down the 
street arm-in-arm, and into all the shops, and then I’ll 
choose my house, and you’ll choose your house, and we’ll 
live there like princes and good fellows ” 



THE ROMAN ROAD 63 

“ O, but you’ll stay in my house, won’t you ? ” I cried ; 
“ I wouldn’t ask everybody ; but I’ll ask_yo«.” 

He affected to consider a moment ; then “ Right ! ” he 
said : “ I believe you mean it, and I will come and stay 
with you. I won’t go to anybody else, if they ask me ever 
so much. And I’ll stay quite a long time, too, and I won’t 
be any trouble.” 

Upon this compact we parted, and I went down- 
heartedly from the man who understood me, back to 
the house where I never could do anything right. How 
was it that everything seemed natural and sensible to him, 
which these uncles, vicars, and other grown-up men took 
for the merest tomfoolery? Well, he would explain this, 
and many another thing, when we met again. The 
Knight’s Road ! How it always brought consolation ! 
Was he possibly one of those vanished knights I had been 
looking for so long ^ Perhaps he would be in armour next 
time — why not ? He would look well in armour, I thought. 
And I would take care to get there first, and see the sun- 
light flash and play on his helmet and shield, as he rode up 
the High Street of the Golden City 

Meantime, there only remained the finding it. An easy 
matter. 



THE SECRET DRAWER 


I T must surely have served as a boudoir for the ladies 
of old time, this little used, rarely entered chamber 
where the neglected old bureau stood. There was some- 
thing very feimnine in the faint hues of its faded brocades, 
in the rose and blue of such bits of china as yet remained, 
and in the delicate old-world fragrance of pot-pourri from 
the great bowl, — blue and white, with funny holes in its 
cover, — that stood on the bureau’s flat top. Modern 
aunts disdained this out-of-the-way, backwater, upstairs 
room, preferring to do their accounts and grapple with their 
correspondence in some central position more in the whirl 
of things, whence one eye could be kept on the carriage- 
drive, while the other was alert for malingering servants 
and marauding children Those aunts of a former genera- 
tion — I sometimes felt — would have suited our habits 
better. But even by us children, to whom few places were 
private or reserved, the room was visited but rarely. To 
be sure, there was nothing particular in it that we coveted 
or required. Only a few spindle-legged, gilt-backed chairs, 
• — an old harp on which, so the legend ran. Aunt Eliza 
herself used once to play, in years remote, unchronicled ; a 
corner-cupboard with a few pieces of china ; and the old 
bureau But one other thing the room possessed, peculiar 
to Itself ; a certain sense of privacy — ^a power of making 
the intruder feel that he was intruding — ^perhaps even a 
faculty of hinting that someone might have been sitting 
on those chairs, writing at the bureau, or fingering the 
china, just a second before one entered No such violent 
word as “ haunted ” could piossibly apply to this pleasant 
old-fashioned chamber, which indeed we all rather liked ; 

64 



THE SECRET DRAWER 65 

but there was no doubt it was reserved and stand-offish, 
keeping itself to itself. 

Uncle Thomas was the first to draw my attention to the 
possibilities of the old bureau. He was pottering about the 
house one afternoon, having ordered me to keep at his 
heels for company — ^he was a man who hated to be left one 
minute alone — ^when his eye fell on it. “ H’m ! Sheraton ! ” 
he remarked. (He had a smattering of most things, this 
uncle, especially the vocabularies.) Then he let down the 
flap, and examined the empty pigeon-holes and dusty 
panelling. “ Fine bit of inlay,” he went on • “ good work, 
all of it. I know the sort There’s a secret drawer in there 
somewhere ” Then as I breathlessly drew near, he sud- 
denly exclaimed : “ By Jove, I do want to smoke ' ” 
And, wheeling round, he abruptly fled for the garden, 
leaving me with the cup dashed from my lips. What a 
strange thing, I mused, was this smoking, that takes a man 
suddenly, be he in the court, the camp, or the grove, 
grips him like an Afreet, and whirls him off to do its 
imperious behests ' Would it be even so with myself, I 
wondered, m those unknown grown-up years to come ? 

But I had no time to waste in vain speculations My 
whole being was still vibrating to those magic syllables 
“ secret drawer ” ; and that particular chord had been 
touched that never fails to thrill responsive to such words 
as cave, trap-door, shding-panel, bullion, ingots, or Spanish 
dollars. For, besides its own special bliss, who ever heard of 
a secret drawer with nothing in it ^ And O I did want 
money so badly ! I mentally ran over the list of demands 
which were pressing me the most imperiously 

First, there was the pipe I wanted to give George 
Jannaway. George, who was Martha’s young man, was 
a shepherd, and a great ally of mine ; and the last fair he 
was at, when he bought his sweetheart fairings, as a right- 
minded shepherd should, he had purchased a lovely snake 
expressly for me ; one of the wooden sort, with joints, 
waggling deliciously in the hand ; with yellow spots on a 
green ground, sticky and strong-smelling, as a fresh-painted 
5 



66 THE SECRET DRAWER 

snake ought to be ; and with a red&gt;flannel tongue pasted 
cunningly into its jaws. I loved it much, and took it to bed 
with me every night, till what time its spinal cord was 
loosed and it fell apart, and went the way of all mortal 
joys. I thought it very nice of George to think of me at the 
fair, and that’s why I wanted to give him a pipe. When the 
young year was chill and lambing-time was on, George 
inhabited a little wooden house on wheels, far out on the 
wintry downs, and saw no faces but such as were sheepish 
and woolly and mute ; and when he and Martha were 
married, she was going to carry his dinner out to him every 
day, two miles ; and after it, perhaps he would smoke my 
pipe. It seemed an idyllic sort of existence, for both the 
parties concerned ; but a pipe of quality, a pipe fitted to be 
part of a life such as this, could not be procured (so Martha 
informed me) for a smaller sum than eighteenpence. And 
meantime ! 

Then there was the fourpcncc I owed Edward ; not 
that he was bothering me for it, but I knew he was in need 
of it himself, to pay back Selina, who wanted it to make 
up a sum of two shillings, to buy Harold an ironclad for his 
approaching birthday, — H M.S. Majestic, now lying use- 
lessly careened in the toyshop window, just when her 
country had such sore need of her. 

And then there was that boy in the village who had 
caught a young squirrel, and I had never yet possessed one, 
and he wanted a shilling for it, but I knew that for ninepence 
in cash — but what was the good of these sorry threadbare 
reflections ? I had wants enough to exhaust any possible 
find of bullion, even if it amounted to half a sovereign. 
My only hope now lay in the magic drawer, and here I was, 
standing and letting the precious minutes slip by ! Whether 
“ findings ” of this sort could, morally speaking, be con- 
sidered “ keepings,” was a point that did not occur to me. 

The room was very still as I approached the bureau ; 
possessed, it seemed to be, by a sort of hush of expectation. 
The faint odour of orris-root that floated forth as I let down 
the flap, seemed to identify itself with the yellows and 



THE SECRET DRAWER 67 

browns of the old wood, till hue and scent were of one 
quality and interchangeable. Even so, ere this, the pot- 
pourri had mixed itself with the tints of the old brocade, 
and brocade and pot-pourri had long been one. With 
expectant fingers I explored the empty pigeon-holes and 
sounded the depths of the softly-sliding drawers. No books 
that I knew of gave any general recipe for a quest like this ; 
but the glory, should I succeed unaided, would be all the 
greater. 

To him who is destined to arrive, the fates never fail to 
afford, on the way, their small encouragements. In less 
than two minutes, 1 had come across a rusty button-hook. 
This was truly magnificent. In the nursery there existed, 
indeed, a general button-hook, common to either sex ; 
but none of us possessed a private and special button-hook, 
to lend or to refuse as suited the high humour of the 
moment. I pocketed the treasure carefully, and proceeded. 
At the back of another drawer, three old foreign stamps told 
me I was surely on the high-road to fortune. 

Following on these bracing incentives, came a dull blank 
period of unrewarded search. In vain I removed all the 
drawers and felt over every inch of the smooth surfaces, 
from front to back. Never a knob, spring or projection met 
the thrilling finger-tips ; unyielding the old bureau stood, 
stoutly guarding its secret, if secret it really had. 1 began 
to grow weary and disheartened. This was not the fost 
time that Uncle Thomas had proved shallow, uninformed, 
a guide into blind alleys where the echoes mocked you. 
Was it any good persisting longer? Was anything any 
good whatever? In my mind I began to review past 
disappointments, and life seemed one long record of failure 
and of non-arrival. Disillusioned and depressed, I left my 
work and went to the window. The light was ebbing from 
the room, and seemed outside to be collecting itself on the 
horizon for its concentrated effort of sunset. Far down the 
garden. Uncle Thomas was holding Edward in the air 
reversed, and smacking him. Edward, gurgling hysterically, 
was striking blind fists in the direction where he judged his 



68 THE SECRET DRAWER 

uncle’s stomach should rightly be ; the contents of his 
pockets — a motley show — were strewing the lawn. Some- 
how, though I had been put through a similar performance 
myself an hour or two ago, it all seemed very far away and 
cut off from me. 

Westwards the clouds were massing themselves in a low 
violet bank ; below them, to north and south, as far round 
as eye could reach, a narrow streak of g^ld ran out and 
stretched away, straight along the horizon. Somewhere 
very far off, a horn was blowing, clear and thin ; it sounded 
like the golden streak grown audible, while the gold seemed 
the visible sound. It pricked my ebbing courage, this 
blended strain of music and colour. I turned for a last 
effort ; and Fortune thereupon, as if half-ashamed of the 
unworthy game she had been playing with me, relented, 
opening her clenched fist Hardly had I put my hand once 
more to the obdurate wood, when with a sort of small sigh, 
almost a sob — as it were — of relief, the secret drawer sprang 
open. 

I drew it out and carried it to the window, to examine it 
in the failing light. Too hopeless had I gradually grown, 
in my dispiriting search, to expect very much ; and yet at 
a glance I saw that my basket of glass lay m shivers at my 
feet No ingots nor dollars were here, to crown me the 
little Monte Cnsto of a week Outside, the distant horn had 
ceased its gnat-song, the gold was paling to primrose, and 
everything was lonely and still Within, my confident 
little castles were tumbling down like so many card-houses, 
leaving me stripped of estate, both real and personal, and 
dominated by the depressing reaction 

And yet, — as I looked at the small collection that lay 
within that drawer of disillusions, some warmth crept back 
to my heart as I recognized that a kindred spirit to my own 
had been at the making of it Two tarnished gilt buttons — 
naval, apparently — a portrait of a monarch unknown to me, 
cut from some antique print and deftly coloured by hand 
in just my own bold style of brush-work — some foreign 
copper coins, thicker and clumsier of make than those I 



THE SECRET DRAWER 6g' 

hoarded myself— and a list of bird’s-eggs, with names of 
the places where they had been found. Also, a ferret’s 
muzzle, and a twist of tarry string, still faintly aromatic ! 
It was a real boy’s hoard, then, that I had happened upon. 
He too had found out the secret drawer, this happy-starred 
young person ; and here he had stowed away his treasures, 
one by one, and had cherished them secretly awhile ; and 
then — ^what ? Well, one would never know now the reason 
why these priceless possessions still lay here unreclaimed ; 
but across the void stretch of years I seemed to touch hands 
a moment with my little comrade of seasons — how many 
seasons ^ — ^long since dead. 

I restored the drawer, with its contents, to the trusty 
bureau, and heard the spring click with a certain satisfac- 
tion. Some other boy, perhaps, would some day release 
that spring again I trusted he would be equally apprecia- 
tive As I opened the door to go, I could hear, from the 
nursery at the end of the passage, shouts and yells, telhng 
that the hunt was up Bears, apparently, or bandits, were 
on the evening bill of fare, judging by the character of the 
noises. In another minute I would be in the thick of it, 
in all the warmth and light and laughter. And yet — what 
a long way off it all seemed, both in space and time, to me 
yet lingering on the threshold of that old-world chamber ! 



THE BLUE ROOM 


T hat nature has her moments of sympathy with man 
has been noted often enough, — and generally as a 
new discovery. To us, who had never known any other 
•condition of things, it seemed entirely right and fitting 
•that the wind sang and sobbed in the jioplar tops, and, in 
the lulls of it, sudden spirts of rain spattered the already 
•dusty roads, on that blusterous March day when Edward 
and I awaited, on the station platform, the arrival of the 
new tutor. Needless to say, this arrangement had been 
planned by an aunt, from some fond idea that our shy, 
innocent young natures would unfold themselves during 
the walk from the station, and that, on the revelation of 
each other’s more solid qualities that must inevitably ensue, 
an enduring friendship, springing from mutual respect, 
might be firmly based. A pretty dream, — nothing more. 
For Edward, who foresaw that the brunt of tutorial oppres- 
sion would have to be borne by him, was sulky, mono- 
syllabic, and determined to be as negatively disagreeable as 
good manners would permit. It was therefore evident 
that I would have to be spokesman and purveyor of hollow 
civilides, and I was none the more amiable on that account ; 
all courtesies, welcomes, explanations, and other court- 
chamberlain kind of business, being my special aversion. 
There was much of the tempestuous March weather in the 
hearts of both of us, as we sullenly glowered along the 
carriage-windows of the slackening train 

One IS apt, however, to misjudge the special difficulties 
of a situation ; and the reception proved, after all, an easy 
and informal matter. In a trainful so uniformly bucolic, 
a tutor was readily recognizable ; and his portmanteau 
had been consigned to the luggage-cart, and his person

conveyed into the lane, before I had discharged one of my 
carefully considered sentences. I breathed more easily, 
and looking up at our new friend as we stepped out together, 
remembered that we had been counting on something 
altogether more arid, scholastic, and severe. A boyish eager 
face and a petulant pince-nez — untidy hair — a head of con- 
stant quick turns like a robin’s, and a voice that kept break- 
ing into alto — these were all very strange and new, but 
not in the least terrible. 

He proceeded jerkily through the village, with glances 
on this side and that ; and “ Charming,” he broke out 
presently ; “ quite too charming and delightful ! ” 

I had not counted on this sort of thing, and glanced for 
help to Edward, who, hands in pockets, looked grimly 
down his nose. He had taken his line, and meant to stick 
to it. 

Meantime our friend had made an imaginary spy-glass 
out of his fist, and was squinting through it at something 
I could not perceive. “ What an exquisite bit ! ” he burst 
out. “ Fifteenth century — ^no — ^yes it is ! ” 

I began to feel puzzled, not to say alarmed. It reminded 
me of the butcher in the Arabian Nights, whose common 
joints, displayed on the shop-front, took to a startled public 
the appearance of dismembered humanity. This man 
seemed to see the strangest things in our dull, familiar 
surroundings. 

“ Ah ! ” he broke out again, as we jogged on between 
hedgerows : “ and that field now — backed by the downs — 
with the rain-cloud brooding over it, — that’s all David 
Cox — every bit of it I ” 

“ That field belongs to Farmer Larkin,” I explained 
politely ; for of course he could not be expected to know. 
” I’ll take you over to Farmer Cox’s to-morrow, if he’s a 
friend of yours ; but there’s nothing to see there.” 

Edward, who was hanging sullenly behind, made a face 
at me, as if to say, “ What sort of lunatic have we got 
here ? ” 

” It has the true pastoral character, this country of 



7a THE BLUE ROOM 

yours,” went on our enthusiast : “ with just that added 
touch in cottage and farmstead, relics of a bygone art, 
which makes our English landscape so divine, so unique 1 ” 

Really this grasshopper was becoming a burden ! 
These familiar fields and farms, of which we knew every 
blade and stick, had done nothing that I knew of to be 
bespattered with adjectives in this way. I had never 
thought of them as divine, unique, or anything else They 
were — ^well, they were just themselves, and there was an 
end of It. Despairingly I jogged Edward in the ribs, as a 
sign to start rational conversation, but he only grinned and 
continued obdurate. 

“ You can see the house now,” I remarked presently ; 
“ and that’s Selina, chasing the donkey in the paddock. 
Or is It the donkey chasing Sehna ? I can’t quite make out ; 
but It’s Ikem, anyhow.” 

Needless to say, he exploded with a full charge of adjec- 
tives. “ Exquisite ’ ” he rapped out ; ” so mellow and 
harmonious ' and so entirely in keeping ! ” (I could see 
from Edward’s face that he was thinking who ought to be 
in keeping ) “ Such possibihties of romance, now, in those 
old gables ' ” 

“ If you mean the garrets,” I said, “ there’s a lot of old 
furniture in them ; and one is generally full of apples ; 
and the bats get in sometimes, under the eaves, and flop 
about till we go up with hair-brushes and things and drive 
’em out ; but there’s nothing else in them that I know of.” 

“ O, but there must be more than bats,” he cried. 
“ Don’t tell me there are no ghosts. I shall be deeply 
disappointed if there aren’t any ghosts ” 

I did not think it worth while to reply, feeling really 
unequal to this sort of conversation. Besides, we were 
nearing the house, when my task would be ended Aunt 
Eliza met us at the door, and in the cross-fire of adjectives 
that ensued — both of them talking at once, as grown-up 
folk have a habit of doing — we two slippied round to the 
back of the house and speedily put several broad acres 
between us and civilization, for fear of being ordered in to

tea in the drawing-room. By the time we returned our 
new importation had gone up to dress for dinner, so till the 
morrow at least we were free of him. 

Meanwhile the March wind, after dropping a while at 
sundown, had been steadily increasing in volume ; and 
although I fell asleep at my usual hour, about midnight 
I was wakened by the stress and the cry of it. In the bright 
moonlight, wind-swung branches tossed and swayed eerily 
across the blinds ; there was rumbling in chimneys, whist- 
ling in keyholes, and everywhere a clamour and a call. 
Sleep was out of the question, and, sitting up in bed, I 
looked round. Edward sat up too. “ I was wondering 
when you were going to wake,” he said. “ It’s no good 
trying to sleep through this I vote we get up and do 
something ” 

“ I’m game,” I replied. “ Let’s play at being m a ship 
at sea ” (the plaint of the old house under the buffeting 
wind suggested this, naturally) ; “ and we can be wrecked 
on an island, or left on a raft, whichever you choose ; but 
I like an island best myself, because there’s more things 
on It.” 

Edward on reflection negatived the idea. “ It would 
make too much noise,” he jKiinted out. “ There’s no fun 
playing at ships, unless you can make a jolly good row.” 

The door creaked, and a small figure in white slippted 
cautiously in. “ Thought I heard you talking,” said Char- 
lotte. “ We don’t like it , we’re afraid — Selma too ' She’ll 
be here in a minute. She’s putting on her new dressing- 
gowm she’s so proud of.” 

His arms round his knees, Edward cogitated deeply until 
Selina appeared, barefooted, and looking slim and tall in 
the new dressing-gown. Then, “ Look here,” he exclaimed ; 
“ now we’re all together, I vote we go and explore ' ” 

“ You’re always wanting to explore,” I said. “ What on 
earth is there to explore for in this house ? ” 

” Biscuits ! ” said the inspired Edward. 

“ Hooray ! Come on ! ” chimed in Harold, sitting 
up suddenly. He had been awake all the time, but had 



74 THE BLUE ROOM 

been shamming asleep, lest he should be fagged to do 
anything. 

It was indeed a fact, as Edward had remembered, that 
our thoughtless elders occasionally left the biscuits out, a 
prize for the night-walking adventurer with nerves of steel. 

Edward tumbled out of bed and pulled a baggy old pair 
of knickerbockers over his bare shanks. Then he girt 
himself with a belt, into which he thrust, on the one side a 
large wooden pistol, on the other an old single-stick ; and 
finally he donned a big slouch-hat — once an uncle’s — ^that 
we used for playing Guy Fawkes and Charles-the-Sccond- 
up-a-trce in. Whatever the audience, Edward, if possible, 
always dressed for his parts with care and conscientious- 
ness I while Harold and I, true Elizabethans, cared little 
about the mounting of the piece, so long as the real dramatic 
heart of it beat sound. 

Our commander now enjoined on us a silence deep as the 
grave, reminding us that Aunt Eliza usually slept with an 
open door, past which we had to file 

“ But we’ll take the short cut through the Blue Room,” 
said the wary Selina. 

” Of course,” said Edward approvingly. “ I forgot about 
that Now then ! You lead the way ! ” 

The Blue Room had in prehistoric times been added to 
by taking in a superfluous passage, and so not only had the 
advantage of two doors, but also enabled us to get to the 
head of the stairs without passing the chamber wherein 
our dragon-aunt lay couched. It was rarely occupied, 
except when a casual uncle came down for the night. We 
entered in noiseless file, the room being plunged in darkness, 
except for a bright strip of moonlight on the floor, across 
which we must pass for our exit. On this our leading 
lady chose to pause, seizing the opportunity to study the 
hang of her new dressing-gown. Greatly satisfied thereat, 
she proceeded, after the feminine fashion, to peacock and 
to pose, pacing a minuet down the moonlit patch with an 
imaginary partner. This was too much for Edward’s 
histrionic instincts, and after a moment’s pause he drew his

75 

single-stick, and, with flourishes meet for the occasion, 
str^e on to the stage. A struggle ensued on approved lines, 
at the end of which Selina was stabbed slowly and with 
unction, and her corpse borne from the chamber by the 
ruthless cavalier. The rest of us rushed after in a clump, 
with capers and gesticulations of delight ; the special 
charm of the performance lying m the necessity for its 
being carried out with the dumbest of dumb shows. 

Once out on the dark landing, the noise of the storm 
without told us that we had exaggerated the necessity for 
silence ; so, grasping the tails of each other’s night-gowns, 
even as Alpine climbers rope themselves together in perilous 
places, we fared stoutly down the staircase-moraine, and 
across the grim glacier of the hall, to where a faint glimmer 
from the half-open door of the drawing-room beckoned to 
us like friendly hostel-hghts Entering, we found that our 
thrifdess semors had left the sound red heart of a fire, 
easily coaxed into a cheerful blaze ; and biscmts — a 
plat^l — smiled at us in an encouraging sort of way, to- 
gether with the halves of a lemon, already squeezed, but 
still suckable. The biscuits were righteously shared, the 
lemon segments passed from mouth to mouth ; and as we 
squatted round the fire, its genial warmth consoling our 
unclad limbs, we realized that so many nocturnal perils 
had not been braved in vain 

“ It’s a funny thing,” said Edi\ard, as we chatted, 
“ how I hate this room in the daytime. It always means 
having your face washed, and your hair brushed, and talk- 
ing silly company talk. But to-night it’s really quite jolly. 
Looks different, somehow.” 

“ I never can make out,” I said, " what people come here 
to tea for. They can have their own tea at home if they like 
— they’re not poor people — withj'am and things, and drink 
out of their saucer, and suck their fingers and enjoy them- 
selves ; but they come here from a long way off, and sit 
up straight with their feet off the bars of their chairs, 
and have one cup, and talk the same sort of stuff every 
time.” 



76 THE BLUE ROOM 

Selina sniffed disdainfully. “ You don’t know anything 
about it,” she said. ” In society you have to call on each 
other. It’s the proper thing to do.” 

“ Pooh ! you're not in society,” said Edward politely ; 
“and, what’s more, you never will be.” 

“ Yes, I shall, some day,” retorted Selina ; “ but I shan’t 
ask you to come and see me, so there ! ” 

“ Wouldn’t come if you did,” growled Edward. 

“ Well, you won’t get the chance,” rejoined our sister, 
claiming her right of the last word There was no heat 
about these little amenities, which made up&gt; — as understood 
by us — the art of polite conversation. 

“ I don’t like society people,” put in Harold from the 
sofa, where he was sprawling at full length — a sight the 
daylight hours would have blushed to witness. “ There 
were some of ’em here this afternoon, when you two had 
gone off to the station Oh, and I found a dead mouse 
on the lawn, and I wanted to skin it, but I wasn’t sure I 
knew how, by myself ; and they came out into the garden, 
and patted my head — I wish people wouldn’t do that — and 
one of ’em asked me to pick her a flower. Don’t know why 
she couldn’t pick it herself ; but I said, ‘ All right, I will if 
you’ll hold my mouse ’ But she screamed, and threw it 
away ; and Augustus (the cat) got it, and ran away with it. 
I believe it was really his mouse all the time, ’cos he’d 
been looking about as if he had lost something, so I wasn’t 
angry with htm. But what did she want to throw away my 
mouse for ^ ” 

“ You have to be careful with mice,” reflected Edward ; 
“ they’re such slippery things Do you remember we 
were playing with a dead mouse once on the piano, and the 
mouse was Robinson Crusoe, and the piano was the island, 
and somehow Crusoe slipped down inside the island, into 
Its works, and we couldn’t get him out, though we tried 
rakes and all sorts of things, till the tuner came. And that 
wasn’t till a week after, and then ” 

Here Charlotte who had been nodding solemnly, fell 
over into the fender ; and we realized that the wind had

dropped at last, and the house was lapped in a great still- 
ness. Our vacant beds seemed to be calling to us im- 
periously ; and we were all glad when Edward gave the 
signal for retreat. At the top of the staircase Harold un- 
expectedly turned mutinous, insisting on his right to slide 
down the banisters in a free country. Circumstances did 
not allow of argument ; I suggested frog’s-marching instead, 
and accordingly frog’s-marched he was, the procession 
passing solenmly across the moonlit Blue Room, with 
Harold horizontal and limply submissive. Snug in bed 
at last, I was just slipping off into slumber when I heard 
Edward explode, with chuckle and snort. 

“ By Jove ! ” he said ; “ I forgot all about it The new 
tutor’s sleeping in the Blue Room ' ” 

“ Lucky he didn’t wake up and catch us,” I grunted 
drowsily ; and, without another thought on the matter, 
we both sank into well-earned repose 

Next morning, coming down to breakfast braced to 
grapple with fresh adversity, we were surprised to find our 
garrulous friend of the previous day — he was late in making 
his appearance — strangely silent and (apparently) pre- 
occupied. Having polished off our porridge, we ran out to 
feed the rabbits, explaining to them that a beast of a tutor 
would prevent their enjoying so much of our society as 
formerly 

On returning to the house at the fated hour appointed 
for study, we were thunderstruck to see the station-cart 
disappearing down the drive, freighted with our new 
acquaintance. Aunt Eliza was brutally uncommunicative ; 
but she was overheard to remark casually that she thought 
the man must be a lunatic. In this theory we were only 
too ready to concur, dismissing thereafter the whole matter 
from 01 jf minds 

Some weeks later it happened that Uncle Thomas, 
while paying us a flying visit, produced from his pocket 
a copy of the latest weekly. Psyche ■ a Journal of the Unseen ; 
and proceeded laboriously to rid himself of much incom- 
prehensible humour, apparently at our expense. We bore

it patiently, with the forced grin demanded by convention, 
anxious to get at the source ofinspiration, which it presently 
appeared lay in a paragraph circumstantially describing 
our modest and humdrum habitation. “ Case m,” it began. 
“ The following particulars were communicated by a 
young member of the Society, of undoubted probity and 
earnestness, and arc a chronicle of actual and recent 
experience.” A fairly accurate description of the house 
followed, with details that were unmistakable ; but to this 
there succeeded a flood of meaningless drivel about appari- 
tions, nightly vistants, and the like, writ in a manner be- 
tokening a disordered mind, coupled with a feeble imagina- 
tion The fellow was not even original. All the old material 
was there — the storm at night, the haunted chamber, the 
white lady, the murder re-enacted, and so on — already 
worn threadbare in many a Christmas Number. No one 
was able to make head or tail of the stuff, or of its connexion 
with our quiet mansion ; and yet Edward, who had always 
suspected the fellow, persisted in maintaining that our tutor 
of a brief span was, somehow or other, at the bottom of it. 



THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 


I N the matter of general culture and attainments, we 
youngsters stood on pretty level ground. True, it was 
always happening that one of us would be singled out at 
any moment, freakishly, and without regard to his own 
preferences, to wrestle with the inflections of some idiotic 
language long rightly dead ; while another, from some 
fancied artistic tendency which always failed to justify itself, 
might be told off without warning to hammer out scales 
and exercises, and to bedew the senseless keys with tears of 
weariness or of revolt. But in subjects common to either 
sex, and held to be necessary even for him whose ambition 
soared no higher than to crack a whip iu a circus-ring — 
in geography, for instance, arithmetic, or the weary doings 
of kings and queens — each would have scorned to excel. 
And, indeed, whatever our individual gifts, a general 
dogged determination to shirk and to evade kept us all at 
much the same dead level, — a level of ignorance tempered 
by insubordination. 

Fortunately there existed a wide range of subjects, of 
healthier tone than those ^tlready enumerated, in which 
we were free to choose for ourselves, and which we would 
have scorned to consider education ; and in these we freely 
followed each his own particular line, often attaining an 
amount of special knowledge which struck our ignorant 
elders as simply uncanny. For Edward, the uniforms, 
accoutrements, colours, and mottoes of the regiments 
composing the British Army had a special glamour. In 
the matter of facings he was simply faultless ; among 
chevrons, badges, medals, and stars, he moved familiarly ; 
he even knew the names of most of the colonels in com- 
mand ; and he would squander sunny hours prone on the 

79 



8o THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 

lawn, heedless of challenge from bird or beast, poring over 
a tattered Army List. My own accomplishment was of 
another character — took, as it seemed to me, a wider and 
a more untrammelled range. Dragoons might have swag- 
gered in Lincoln green, riflemen might have donned 
sporrans over tartan trews, without exciting notice or 
comment from me. But did you seek prease information 
as to the fauna of the American continent, then you had 
come to the right shop Where and why the bison 
“ wallowed ” ; how beaver were to be trapped and wild 
turkeys stalked ; the grizzly and how to handle him, 
and the pretty pressing ways of the constrictor, — in fine, 
the haunts and the habits of all that burrowed, strutted, 
roared, or wriggled between the Atlantic and the Pacific, — 
all this knowledge I took for my province. By the others 
my equipment was fully recogmzed. Supposing a book 
with a bear-hunt in it made its way into the house, and the 
atmosphere was electric with excitement ; still, it was 
necessary that I should first decide whether the slot had 
been properly described and properly followed up, ere 
the work could be stampied with full approval. A writer 
might have won fame throughout the civilized globe for 
his trappers and his reahstic backwoods, and all went for 
nothing. If his pemmican were not properly compounded 
I damned his achievement, and it was heard no more of. 

Harold was hardly old enough to possess a special 
subject of his own He had his instincts, indeed, and at 
bird’s-nesting they almost amounted to prophecy. Where 
we others only suspected eggs, surmised possible eggs, 
hinted doubtfully at eggs in the neighbourhood, Harold 
went straight for the right bush, bough, or hole as if he 
carried a divining-rod But this faculty belonged to the 
class of mere gifts, and was not to be ranked with Edward’s 
lore regarding facings, and mine as to the habits of praine- 
dogs, both gained by painful study and extensive travel 
in those “ realms of gold,” the Army List and Ballantyne. 

Selina’s subject, quite unaccountably, happened to be 
naval history. There is no laying down rules as to subjects ; 



THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 8i 

you just possess them — or rather, they possess you — and 
their genesis or protoplasm is rarely to be tracked down. 
Selina had never so much as seen the sea ; but for that 
matter neither had I ever set foot on the American conti- 
nent, the by-ways of which I knew so intimately. And just 
as I, if set down without warning in the middle of the Rocky 
Mountains, would have been perfectly at home, so Selina, 
if a genie had dropped her suddenly on Portsmouth Hard, 
could have given points to most of its frequenters. From 
the days of Blake down to the death of Nelson (she never 
condescended further) Selina had taken spiritual part in 
every notable engagement of the British Navy ; and even 
in the dark days when she had to pick up skirts and Bee, 
chased by an ungallant De Ruyter or Van Tromp, she was 
yet cheerful in the consciousness that ere long she would be 
gleefully hammering the Beets of the world, in the glorious 
times to follow. When that golden period arrived, Selma 
was busy indeed ; and, while loving best to stand where the 
splinters were flying the thickest, she was also a careful 
and critical student of seamanship and of manoeuvre. She 
knew the order in which the great hne-of-battle ships moved 
into action, the vessels they respectively engaged, the 
moment when each let go its anchor, and which of them 
had a spring on its cable (while not understanding the 
phrase, she carefully noted the fact) ; and she habitually 
went into an engagement on the quarter-deck of the gallant 
ship, that reserved its fire the longest. 

At the time of Selina’s weird seizure I was unfortunately 
away from home, on a loathsome visit to an aunt ; and 
my account is therefore feebly compounded from hearsay. 
It was an absence I never ceased to regret — scoring it up, 
with a sense of injury, against the aunt. There was a 
splendid uselessness about the whole performance that 
specially appealed to my artistic sense. That it should 
have been Selina, too, who should break out this way — 
Selina, who had just become a regular subscriber to the 
Toung Ladies' Jottnud, and who allowed herself to be taken 
out to strange teas with an air of resignation palpably 
6 



82 THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 

assumed — this was a special joy, and served to remind me 
that much of this dreaded convention that was creeping 
over us might be, after all, only veneer. Edward also was 
absent, getting licked into shape at school ; but to him the 
loss was nothing. With his stem practical bent he wouldn’t 
have seen any sense in it — ^to recall one of his favourite 
expressions. To Harold, however, for whom the gods had 
always cherished a special tenderness, it was granted, not 
only to witness, but also, priesthke, to feed the sacred fire 
itself. And if at the time he paid the penalty exacted by 
the sordid unimaginative ones who temporarily rule the 
roast, he must ever after, one feels sure, have carried inside 
him some of the white gladness of the acolyte who, greatly 
privileged, has been permitted to swing a censer at the 
sacring of the very Mass. 

October was mellowing fast, and with it the year itself ; 
full of tender hints, in woodland and hedgerow, of a course 
well-nigh completed From all sides that still afternoon 
you caught the quick breathing and sob of the runner 
nearing the goal. Preoccupied and possessed, Selina had 
strayed down the garden and out into the pasture beyond, 
where, on a bit of rising ground that dominated the garden 
on one side and the downs with the old coach-road on the 
other, she had cast herself down to chew the cud of fancy. 
There she was presently joined by Harold, breathless and 
very full of his latest grievance 

“ I asked him not to,” he burst out. “ I said if he’d only 
please wait a bit and Edward would be back soon, and it 
couldn’t matter to htm, and the pig wouldn’t mind, and 
Edward’d be pleased and everybody’d be happy. But he 
just said he was very sorry, but bacon didn’t wait for 
nobody. So I told him he was a regular beast, and then 
I came away. And — and I b’heve they’re doing it now ! ” 

“ Yes, he’s a beast,” agreed Selina, absently. She had 
forgotten all about the pig-killing. Harold kicked away a 
freshly thrown-up mole-hill, and prodded down the hole 
with a stick. From the direction of Farmer Larkin’s 
demesne came a long-drawn note of sorrow, a thin cry and 



THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 83 

appeal, telling that the stout soul of a black Berkshire 
pig was already faring down the stony track to Hades. 

“ D’you know what day it is ? ” said Selina presently, 
in a low voice, looking far away before her. 

Harold did not appear to know, nor yet to care. He 
had laid open his mole-run for a yard or so, and was still 
grumbling at it absorbedly. 

“ It’s Trafalgar Day,” went on Selina, trancedly ; 
“ Trafalgar Day — and nobody cares ' ” 

Something in her tone told Harold that he was not 
behaving quite becomingly. He didn’t exactly know in 
what manner ; still, he abandoned his mole-hunt for a more 
courteous attitude of attention 

“ Over there,” resumed Selina — she was gazing out in 
the direction of the old high road — “ over there the coaches 
used to go by. Uncle Thomas was telling me about it 
the other day. And the people used to watch for ’em 
coming, to tell the time by, and p’r’aps to get their parcels. 
And one morning — they wouldn’t be expecting anything 
different — one morning, first there would be a cloud of 
dust, as usual, and then the coach would come racing by, 
and then they would know ' For the coach would be dressed 
in laurel, all laurel from stem to stern ' And the coachman 
would be wearing laurel, and the guard would be wearing 
laurel ; and then they would know, then they would 
know ! ” 

Harold listened in respectful silence. He would much 
rather have been hunting the mole, who must have been 
a mile away by this time if he had his wits about him. But 
he had all the natural instincts of a gentleman ; of whom it 
is one of the principal marks, if not the complete definition, 
never to show signs of being bored 

Selina rose to her feet, and paced the turf restlessly with a 
short quarter-deck walk. 

“ Why can’t we do something ? ” she burst out presently. 
“ He — ^he did everything — why can’t we do anything for 
him?” 

Who did everything ? ” inquired Harold, meekly. 



84 THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 

It was useless wasting further longings on that mole. Like 
the dead, he travelled fast. 

“ Why, Nelson, of course,” said Selina, shortly, still 
looking restlessly around for help or suggestion. 

“ But he’s — ^he’s dead, isn’t he ? ” asked Harold, slightly 
puzzled. 

“ What’s that got to do with it ? ” retorted his sister, 
resuming her caged-lion promenade. 

Harold was somewhat taken aback. In the case of the 
pig, for instance, whose last outcry had now passed into 
stillness, he had considered the chapter as finally closed. 
Whatever innocent mirth the holidays might hold in store 
for Edward, that particular pig, at least, would not be a 
contributor. And now he was given to understand that the 
situation had not materially changed ! He would have to 
revise his ideas, it seemed. Sitting up on end, he looked 
towards the garden for assistance in the task Thence, even 
as he gazed, a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into 
the still air. The gardener had been sweeping that after- 
noon, and now, an unconscious priest, was offering his 
sacrilege of autumn leaves to the calm-eyed goddess of 
changing hues and chill forebodings who was moving 
slowly about the land that golden afternoon. Harold 
was up and off in a moment, forgetting Nelson, forgetting 
the pig, the mole, the Larkin betrayal, and Selina’s strange 
fever of consaence. Here was fire, real fire, to play with, 
and that was even better than messing with water, or 
remodelling the plastic surface of the earth. Of all the 
toys the world provides for right-minded persons, the 
original elements rank easily the first. 

But Selma sat on where she was, her chin on her fists ; 
and her fancies whirled and drifted, here and there, in 
curls and eddies, along with the smoke she was watching. 
As the quick-footed dusk of the short October day stepped 
lightly over the garden, little red tongues of fire might be 
seen to leap and vanish in the smoke. Harold, anon stag- 
gering under armfuls of leaves, anon stoking vigorously, 
was discernible only at fitful intervals. It was another sort 



THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 85 

ofnnoke that the inner eye of Selina was looking upon, — 
a smoke that hung in sullen banks round the masts and the 
hulls of the fighting ships ; a smoke from beneath which 
came thunder and the crash and the splinter-rip, the shout 
of the boarding-party, the choking sob of the gunner 
stretched by his gun ; a smoke from out of which at last 
she saw, as through a riven pall, the radiant spirit of the 
Victor, crowned with the coronal of a perfect death, leap 
in full assurance up into the ether that Immortals breathe. 
The dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose 
and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire ; 
something of the priestess in her stride, something of the 
devotee m the set purpose of her eye. 

The leaves were well alight by this time, and Harold 
had just added an old furze bush, which flamed and 
crackled stirringly. 

“ Go ’n’ get some more sticks,” ordered Selina, “ and 
shavings, ’n’ chunks of wood, ’n’ anything you can find. 
Look here — ^m the kitchen-garden there’s a pile of old 
pea-sticks. Fetch as many as you can carry, and then go 
back and bring some more ! ” 

“ But I say ” began Harold, amazedly, scarce 

knowing his sister, and with a vision of a frenzied gardener, 
pea-stickless and threatemng retribution. 

“ Go and fetch ’em quick ! ” shouted Selina, stamping 
with impatience 

Harold ran off at once, true to the stern system of disci- 
pline in which he had been nurtured. But his eyes were 
like round O’s, and as he ran he talked fast to himself, in 
evident disorder of mind. 

The pea-sticks made a rare blaze, and the fire, no longer 
smouldering sullenly, leapt up and began to assume the 
appearance of a genuine bonfire. Harold, awed into silence 
at first, began to jump round it with shouts of triumph. 
Selina looked on grimly, with kmtted brow ; she was not 
yet fully satisfied. “ Can’t you get any more sticks ? ” she 
said presently. ” Go and hunt about. Get some old 
hampers and matting and things out of the tool-house. 



86 THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 

Smash up that old cucumber frame Edward shoved you 
into, the day we were playing scouts and Mohicans. 
Stop a bit ! Hooray ! I know. You come along with 

IZXGa 

Hard by there was a hot-house, Aunt Eliza’s special pride 
and joy, and even grimly approved of by the gardener. 
At one end, in an out-house adjoimng, the necessary Bring 
was stored ; and to this sacred fuel, of which we were 
strictly forbidden to touch a stick, Selina went straight. 
Harold followed obediently, prepared for any crime after 
that of the pea-sticks, but pinching himself to see if he were 
really awake. 

“ You bring some coals,” said Selina, briefly, without 
any palaver or pro-and-con discussion. “ Here’s a basket. 
I'll manage the faggots ' ” 

In a very few minutes there was little doubt about its 
being a genuine bonfire and no paltry makeshift. Selina, 
a Maenad now, hatless and tossing disordered locks, all the 
dross of the young lady purged out of her, stalked around 
the pyre of her own purloining, or prodded it with a pea- 
stick. And as she prodded she murmured at intervals, “ I 
knew there was something we could do ! It isn’t much — 
but still It’s something ! ” 

The gardener had gone home to his tea Aunt Eliza 
had driven out for hers a long way off, and was not expected 
back till quite late , and this far end of the garden was not 
overlooked by any windows. So the Tnbute blazed on 
merrily unchecked. Villagers far away, catching sight of 
the flare, muttered something about “ them young devils 
at their tricks again,” and trudged on beer-wards. Never a 
thought of what day it was, never a thought for Nelson, 
who preserved their honest pint-pots, to be paid for in 
honest pence, and saved them from litres and decimal 
coinage. Nearer at hand, frightened rabbits popped up and 
vanished with a flick of white tails ; scared birds fluttered 
among the branches, or sped across the glade to quieter 
sleeping-quarters ; but never a bird nor a beast gave a 
thought to the hero to whom they owed it that each year 



THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER 87 

their little homes of horsehair, wool, or moss, were safe 
stablished ’ncath the flap of the British flag ; and that Game 
Laws, quietly permanent, made la chasse a terror only to 
their betters. No one seemed to know, nor to care, nor 
to sympathize. In all the ecstasy of her burnt-oBering and 
sacrifice, Selina stood alone 

And yet — not quite alone ' For, as the fire was roaring 
at its best, certain stars stepped delicately forth on the 
surface of the immensity above, and peered down doubtfully 
— with wonder at first, then with interest, then with recog- 
nition, with a start of glad surprise They at least knew all 
about it, they understood. Among them the Name was a 
daily familiar word ; his story was a part of the music to 
which they swung, himself was their fellow and their mate 
and comrade So they peeped, and winked, and peeped 
again, and called to their laggard brothers to come quick 
and see. 


“ The best of life is but intoxication ” ; and Selma, who 
during her brief inebriation had lived in an ecstasy as 
golden as our drab existence affords, had to experience 
the inevitable bitterness of awakemng sobriety, when the 
dying down of the flames into sullen embers coincided with 
the frenzied entrance of Aunt Eliza on the scene. It was 
not so much that she wtis at once and for ever disrated, 
broke, sent before the mast, and branded as one on whom 
no reliance could be placed, even with Edward safe at 
school, and myself under the distant vigilance of an aunt ; 
that her pocket-money was stopped indefinitely, and her 
new Church Service, the pride of her last birthday, removed 
from her own custody and placed under the control of a 
Trust. She sorrowed rather because she had dragged poor 
Harold, against his better judgment, into a most horrible 
scrape, and moreover because, when the reaction had 
fairly set in, when the exaltation had fizzled away and the 
young-lady portion of her had crept timorously back to its 
wonted lodging, she could only see herself as a plain fool, 



88 THE TWENTY-nRST OF OCTOBER 

unjustified, undeniable, without a shadow of an excuse 
or explanation. 

As for Harold, youth and a short memory made his case 
less pitiful than it seemed to his more sensitive sister. 
True, he started upstairs to his lonely cot bellowing 
dismally, before him a dreary future of pains and penalties, 
sufficient to last to the crack of doom. Outside bis door, 
however, he tumbled over Augustus the cat, and made 
capture of him ; and at once his mourning was changed into 
a song of triumph, as he conveyed his prize into port. For 
Augustus, who detested above all things going to bed with 
little boys, was ever more knave than fool, and the trapper 
who was wily enough to ensnare him had achieved some- 
thing notable. Augustus, when he realized that his fate 
was sealed, and his night’s lodging settled, wisely made the 
best of things, and listened, with a languorous air of com- 
plete comprehension, to the incoherent babble concerning 
pigs and heroes, moles and bonfires, which served Harold 
for a self-sung lullaby. Yet it may be doubted whether 
Augustus was one of those rare fellows who thoroughly 
understood. 

But Selina knew no more of this source of consolation 
than of the sympathy with which the stars were winking 
above her ; and it was only after some sad interval of time, 
and on a very moist pillow, that she drifted into that 
quaint inconsequent country where you may meet your 
own pet hero strolling down the road, and commit what 
hare-brained oddities you like, and everybody understands 
and appreciates.

T hose memorable days that move in procession, 
their heads just out of the mist of years long dead — 
the most of them are full-eyed as the dandelion that from 
dawn to shade has steeped itself in sunlight. Here and 
there in their ranks, however, moves a forlorn one who is 
blind — blind in the sense of the dulled window-pane on 
which the pelting raindrops have mingled and run down, 
obscuring sunshine and the circling birds, happy fields, 
and storied garden ; blind with the spatter of a misery 
uncomprchended, unanaljscd, only felt as something cor- 
poreal in its buffeting effects. 

Martha began it ; and yet Martha was not really to 
blame. Indeed, that was half the trouble of it — no solid 
person stood full in view, to be blamed and to make atone- 
ment. There was only a wretched, impalpable condition 
to deal with. Breakfast was just over ; the sun was sum- 
moning us, imperious as a herald with clamour of trumpet ; 
I ran ujistairs to her with a broken bootlace in my hand, 
and there she was, crying in a comer, her head in her apron. 
Nothing could be got from her but the same dismal succes- 
sion of sobs that would not have done, that struck and hurt 
like a physical beating ; and meanwhile the sun was getting 
impatient, and I wanted my bootlace. 

Inquiry below stairs revealed the cause. Martha’s 
brother was dead, it seemed — her sailor brother Billy ; 
drowned in one of those strange far-off seas it was our 
dream to navigate one day. We had known Billy well, and 
appreciated him. When an approaching visit of Billy 
to his sister had been announced, we had counted the days 
to it. When his cheery voice was at last heard in the kitchen 
and we had descended with shouts, first of all he had to

exhibit his tattooed arms, always a subject for fresh delight 
and envy and awe ; then he was called upon for tncks, 
jugglings, and strange, fearful gymnastics ; and lastly came 
yarns, and more yarns, and yarns till bedtime. There had 
never been any one like Billy in his own particular sphere ; 
and now he was drowned, they said, and Martha was 
miserable, and — and I couldn’t get a new boodace. They 
told me that Billy would never come back any more, and 
I stared out of the window at the sun which came back, 
right enough, every day, and their news conveyed nothing 
whatever to me. Martha’s sorrow hit home a httle, 
but only because the actual sight and sound of it gave me a 
dull, bad sort of pain low down inside — a pain not to be 
actually located Moreover, I was still wanting my boot- 
lace 

This was a poor sort of a beginning to a day that, so far 
as outside conditions went, had promised so well. I rigged 
up a sort of jury-mast of a bootlace with a bit of old string, 
and wandered off to look up the girls, conscious of ajar and 
a discordance in the scheme of things. The moment I 
entered the schoolroom something in the air seemed to tell 
me that here, too, matters were strained and awry. Selina 
W.1S staring listlessly out of the window, one foot curled 
round her leg When I spoke to her she jerked a shoulder 
testily, but did not condescend to the civility of a reply 
Charlotte, absolutely unoccupied, sprawled in a chair, and 
there were signs of sniffles about her, even at that early 
hour. It was but a trilling matter that had caused all this 
electricity in the atmosphere, and the girls’ manner of 
taking It seemed to me most unreasonable Within the 
last few days the time had come round for the dispatch of a 
hamper to Edward at school. Only one hamper a term was 
permitted him, so its preparation was a sort of blend of 
revelry and religious ceremony. After the main corpus 
of the thing had been carefully selected and safely bestowed 
— the pots of jam, the cake, the sausages, and the apples 
that filled up corners so nicely — after the last package 
had been wedged in, the girls had deposited their own

private and personal offerings on the top. I forget their 
precise nature ; anyhow, they were nothing of any par- 
ticular practical use to a boy. But they had involved some 
contrivance and labour, some skimping of pocket-money, 
and much delightful cloud-bmldmg as to the effect on their 
enraptured recipient. Well, yesterday there had come a 
terse acknowledgment from Edward, heartily commending 
the cakes and the jam, stamping the sausages with the seal 
of Smith major’s approval, and finally hinting that, for- 
tihcd as he now was, nothing more was necessary but a 
remittance of five shillings in postage stamps to enable him 
to face the world armed against every buffet of fate. That 
was all. Never a word or a hint of the personal tributes 
or of his appreciation of them. To us — to Harold and me, 
that is — the letter seemed natural and sensible enough 
After all, provender was the main thing, and five shillings 
stood for a complete equipment against the most unexpected 
turns of luck The presents were very well in their way — 
very nice, and so on — but life was a serious matter, and the 
contest called for cakes and half-crowns to carry it on, not 
gewgaws and knitted mittens and the like. The girls, 
however, in their obstinate way, persisted in taking their 
own view of the slight. Hence it was that I received my 
second rebuff of the morning. 

Somewhat disheartened, I made my way downstairs 
and out into the sunlight, where I found Harold playing 
conspirators bv himself on the gravel. He had dug a small 
hole in the walk and had laid an imaginary tram of powder 
thereto and, as he sought refuge in the laurels from the 
inevitable explosion, I heard him murmur : “ ‘ My God ! ’ 
said the Czar, ‘ my plans are frustrated ! ’ ” It seemed at 
excellent occasion for being a black puma. Harold liked 
black pumas, on the whole, as well as any animal we were 
familiar with. So I launched myself on him, with the 
appropriate howl, rolling him over on the gravel. 

Life may be said to be composed of things that come off 
and things that don’t come off. This thing, unfortunately, 
was one of the things that didn’t come off. From beneath

me I heard a shrill cry of, “ Oh, it’s my sore knee ! ” And 
Harold wriggled himself free from the puma’s clutches, 
bellowing dismally. Now, I honestly didn’t know he had a 
sore knee, and, what’s more, he knew I didn’t know he 
bad a sore knee. According to boy-ethics, therefore, his 
attitude was wrong, sore knee or not, and no apology was 
due from me. I made half-way advances, however, 
suggesting we should he in ambush by the edge of the pond 
and cut off the ducks as they waddled down in simple, 
unsuspecting single file ; then hunt them as bisons flying 
scattered over the vast prairie A fascinating pursuit this, 
and strictly illicit. But Harold would none of my overtures, 
and retreated to the house wailing with full lungs. 

Things were getting simply infernal. I struck out blindly 
for the open country ; and even as I made for the gate a 
shrill voice from a window bade me keep off the flower-beds. 
When the gate had swung to behind me with a vicious click 
I felt better, and after ten minutes along the road it began 
to grow on me that some radical change was needed, 
that I was in a blind alley, and that this intolerable state 
of things must somehow cease. All that I could do I had 
already done. As well-meamng a fellow as ever stepped was 
pounding along the road that day, with an exceeding sore 
heart ; one who only wished to live and let live, in touch 
with his fellows, and appreciating what joys life had to offer. 
What was wanted now was a complete change of environ- 
ment. Somewhere in the world, I felt sure, justice and 
sympathy still resided. There were places called pampas, 
for instance, that sounded well. League upon league of 
grass, with just an occasional wild horse, and not a relation 
within the horizon ! To a bruised spirit this seemed a sane 
and a healing sort of existence. There were other pleasant 
corners, again, where you dived for pearls and stabbed 
sharks in the stomach with your big knife. No relations 
would be likely to come interfering with you when thus 
blissfully occupied. And yet I did not wish— just yet — to 
have done with relations entirely. They should be made 
to feel their position first, to sec thenoselves as they really

were, and to wish — ^when it was too late — ^that they had 
behaved more properly. 

Of all professions, the army seemed to lend itself the most 
thoroughly to the scheme. You enlisted, you followed the 
drum, you marched, fought, and ported arms, under 
strange skies, through unrecorded years. At last, at long 
last, your opportunity would come, when the horrors of 
war were fhckenng through the quiet country-side where 
you were cradled and bred, but where the memory of 
you had long been dim. Folk would run together clamor- 
ous, palsied with fear ; and among the terror-stricken 
groups would hgure certain aunts. “ What hope is left 
us ? ” they would ask themselves, “ save in the clemency 
of the General, the mysterious, invincible General, of whom 
men tell such romantic talcs ? ” And the army would 
march in, and the guns would rattle and leap along the 
village street, and, last of all, you — ^you, the General, the 
fabled hero — ^you would enter, on your coal-black charger, 
your pale set face seamed by an interesting sabre-cut. And 
then — but every boy has rehearsed this familiar piece a 
score of times. You arc magnammous, in fine — that goes 
without saying ; you have a coal-black horse, and a sabre- 
cut, and you can afford to be very magnanimous. But all 
the same you give them a good talkmg-to. 

This pleasant conceit simply ravished my soul for some 
twenty minutes, and then the old sense of injury began to 
well up afresh, and to call for new plasters and soothing 
syrups. This time I took refuge in happy thoughts of the 
sea. The sea was my real sphere, after all. On the sea, 
in especial, you could combine distinction with lawlessness, 
whereas the army seemed to be always weighted by a certain 
plodding submission to discipline. To be sure by all 
accounts the life was at first a rough one. But just then I 
wanted to suffer keenly ; I wanted to be a poor devil of a 
cabin boy, kicked, beaten, and sworn at — ^for a time. Per- 
haps some hint, some inkling of my sufferings might reach 
their ears. In due course the sloop or felucca would turn 
up — ^it always did — the rakish-looking craft, black of hull.

low in the water, and bristling with guns ; the Jolly Roger 
flapping overhead, and myself for sole commander. By 
and by, as usually happened, an East Indiaman would 
come sailing along full of relations — not a necessary relation 
would be missing And the crew should walk the plank, 
and the captain should dance from his own yard&gt;arm, and 
then I would take the passengers in hand — that miserable 
group of well-known figures cowering on the quarter-deck ! 
— and then — and then the same old performance : the 
air thick with magnanimity. In all the repertory of heroes, 
none is more truly magnanimous than your pirate chief. 

When at last I brought myself back from the future to the 
actual present, I found that these delectable visions had 
helped me over a longer stretch of road than I had 
imagined ; and I looked around and took my bearings. 
To the right of me was a long low building of grey stone, 
new, and yet not smugly so ; new, and yet possessing 
distinction, marked with a character that did not depend 
on lichen or on crumbling semi-cffacemcnt of moulding 
and mullion. Strangers might have been puzzled to classify 
It ; to me, an explorer from earliest years, the place was 
familiar enough. Most folk called it “ The Settlement ” ; 
others, with quite sufficient conciseness for our neighbour- 
hood, spoke of “ them there fellows up by Halliday’s ” ; 
others again, with a hint of derision, named them the 
“ monks.” This last title I supposed to be intended for 
satire, and knew to be fatuously wrong. I was thoroughly 
acquainted with monks — ^in books — and well knew the 
cut of their long frocks, their shaven polls, and their fas- 
cinating big dogs, with brandy-bottles round their necks, 
incessantly hauling happy travellers out of the snow. The 
only dog at the settlement was an Irish terrier, and the 
good fellows who owned him, and were owned by him, in 
common, wore clothes of the most nondescript order, and 
mostly cultivated side-whiskers. I had wandered up there 
one day, searching (as usual) for something I never found, 
and had been taken in by them and treated as friend and 
comrade. They had made me free of their ideal little 



DIES IRiE 


95 


rooms, fVdl of books and pictures, and clean of the anti- 
macassar taint ; they had shown me their chapel, high, 
hushed, and faintly scented, beautiful with a strange new 
beauty born both of what it had and what it had not — that 
too familiar dowdiness of common places of worship. They 
had also fed me in their dining-hall, where a long table 
stood on trestles plain to view, and all the woodwork 
was natural, unpainted, healthily scrubbed, and redolent 
of the forest it came from. I brought away from that visit, 
and kept by me for many days, a sense of cleanness, of the 
freshness that pricks the senses — the freshness of cool 
spring water ; and the large swept spaces of the rooms, the 
red tiles, and the oaken settles suggested a comfort that had 
no connexion with padded upholstery 
On this particular morning I was in much too unsociable 
a mind for paying friendly calls. Still, something in the 
aspect of the place harmonired with my humour, and I 
worked my way round to the back, where the ground, after 
affording level enough for a kitchen-garden, broke steeply 
away Both the word Gothic and the thing itself were still 
unknown to me ; vet doubtless the architecture of the 
place, consistent throughout, accounted for its sense of 
comradeship in my hour of disheartenment. As I mused 
there, with the low, grey, purposeful-looking building 
before me, and thought of my pleasant friends within, 
and what good times they always seemed to be having, 
and how they larked with the Irish terrier, whose footing 
was one of a perfect equality, I thought of a certain look in 
their faces, as if they had a common purpose and a business, 
and were acting under orders thoroughly recognized and 
understood. I remembered, too, sometliing that Martha 
had told me, about these same fellows doing “ a power o’ 
good,” and other hints I had collected vaguely, of renounce- 
ments, rules, self-denials, and the like Thereupon, out 
of the depths of my morbid soul swam up a new and fas- 
cinating idea ; and at once the career of arms seemed over- 
acted and stale, and piracy, as a profession, fiat and un- 
profitable. This, then, or something like it, should be my 



96 DIES IRjE 

vocation and my revenge. A severer line of business, 
perhaps, such as I had read of ; something that included 
black bread and a hair-shirt. There should be vows, too — 
irrevocable, blood-curdling vows ; and an iron grating. 
This iron grating was the most necessary feature of all, 
for I intended that on the other side of it my relations 
should range themselves — I mentally ran over the catalogue, 
and saw that the whole gang was present, all in their proper 
places — a sad-eyed row, combined in tristful appeal. 
“ We see our error now,” they would say ; “ we were 
always dull dogs, slow to catch — especially in those akin 
to us — the finer qualities of soul ! We misunderstood you, 

misappreciated you, and we own up to it. And now ” 

“ Alas, my dear friends,” I would strike in here, waving 
towards them an ascetic hand — one of the emaciated sort, 
that lets the light shine through at the finger-tips — “ Alas, 
you come too late ! This conduct is fitting and meritorious 
on your part, and indeed I always expected it of you, 
sooner or later ; but the die is cast, and you may go home 
again and bewail at your leisure this too tardy repentance 
of yours. For me, I am vowed and dedicated, and my 
relations henceforth are austerity and holy works. Once 
a month, should you wish it, it shall be your privilege to 
come and gaze at me through this very solid grating ; 
but ” Whack' 

A well-aimed clod of garden soil, whizzing just past my 
ear, starred on a tree-trunk behind, spattering me with dirt. 
The present came back to me in a flash, and I mmbly took 
cover behind the trees, realizing that the enemy was up and 
abroad, with ambuscades, alarms, and thrilling sallies. 
It was the gardener’s boy, I knew well enough ; a red 
proletariat, who hated me just because I was a gentleman. 
Hastily picking up a nice sticky clod in one hand, with the 
other I delicately projected my hat beyond the shelter of 
the tree-trunk. I had not fought with Redskins all these 
years for nothing 

As I had expected, another clod, of the first class for size 
and stickiness, took my poor hat full in the centre. Then, 



DIES IR/fi 


97 

Ajax-like, shouting terribly, 1 issued from shelter and 
disch 2 u:ged my ammunition. Woe then for the gardener’s 
boy, who, unprepared, skipping in premature triumph, 
took the clod full in his stomach ! He, the foolish one, 
widess on whose side the gods were fighting that day, dis- 
charged yet other missiles, wavering and wide of the mark ; 
for his wind had been taken with the first clod, and he 
shot wildly, as one already desperate and in fhght. I got 
another clod in at short range ; we clinched on the brow 
of the hill, and rolled down to die bottom together. When 
he had shaken himself free and regained his legs, he trotted 
smartly off in the direction of his mother’s cottage ; but 
over his shoulder he discharged at me both imprecadon and 
deprecation, menace mixed up with an under-current of 
tears. 

But as for me, I made off smartly for the road, my frame 
tingling, my head high, with never a backward look at the 
Settlement of suggestive aspect, or at rav well-planned 
future which lay in fragments around it. Life had its 
jollities, then ; life was action, contest, victory ! The 
present was rosy once more, surprises lurked on every side, 
and I was beginning to feel vdloinously hungry. 

Just as I gained the road a cart came rattling by, and I 
rushed for it, caught the chain that hung below, and 
swung thnlhngly between the dizzy wheels, choked and 
blinded with delicious-smelling dust, the world slipping 
by me like a streaky ribbon below, till the driver licked 
at me with his whip, and I had to descend to earth again. 
Abandoning the beaten track, I then struck homewards 
through the fields ; not that the way was very much shorter, 
but rather because on that route one avoided the bridge, 
and had to splash through the stream and get refreshingly 
wet. Bridges were made for narrow folk, for people with 
aims and vocations which compelled abandonment of 
many of life’s highest pleasures. Truly wise men called on 
each element alike to minister to their joy, and while the 
touch of sun-bathed air, the fragrance of garden soil, the 
ductible qualities of mud, and the spark- whirling raptuic 
7 



98 DIES IRiE 

of playing with fire, had each their special charm, they did 
not overlook the bliss of getting their feet wet. As I came 
forth on the common Harold broke out of an adjoining copse 
and ran to meet me, the morning rain-clouds all blown away 
from his face He had made a new squirrel-stick, it seemed. 
Made it all himself ; melted the lead and everything ! 
I examined the instrument critically, and pronounced it 
absolutely magnificent As we passed in at our gate the 
girls were distantly visible, gardening with a zeal in cheerful 
contrast to their heartsick lassitude of the morning. 
“ There’s bin another letter come to-day,” Harold 
explained, “ and the hamper got joggled about on the 
journey, and the presents worked down into the straw and 
all over the place. One of ’em turned up inside the cold 
duck And that’s why they weren’t found at first. And 
Edward said. Thanks awfully ' ” 

I did not see Martha again until we were all reassembled 
at tea-time, when she seemed red-eyed and strangely 
silent, neither scolding nor finding fault with anything. 
Instead, she was very kind and thoughtful with jams and 
things, feverishly pressing unwonted delicacies on us, who 
wanted little pressing enough. Then suddenly, when I was 
busiest, she disappeared ; and Charlotte whispered to me 
presently that she had heard her go to her room and lock 
herself in. This struck me as a funny sort of proceeding. 



THE MAGIC RING 


G ROWN-UP people really ought to be more careful. 

Among themselves it may seem but a small thing to 
give their word and take back their word. For them there 
are so many compensations. Life lies at their feet, a parti- 
coloured india-rubber ball ; they may kick it this way or 
kick it that, it turns up blue, yellow or green, but always 
coloured and glistening. Thus, one sees it happen almost 
every day, and, with a jest and a laugh, the thing is over, 
and the disappointed one turns to fresh pleasure, lying 
ready to his hand. But with those who arc below them, 
whose little globe is swayed by them, \''ho rush to build 
star-pointing alhambras on their most casual word, they 
really ought to be more careful. 

In this case of the circus, for instance, it was not as if we 
had led up to the subject. It was they who b^gan it entirely 
— prompted thereto by the local newspaper. “ What, a 
circus ! ” said they in their irritating, casual wav : “ that 
would be nice to take the children to. Wednesday would 
be a good day. Suppose we go on Wednesday. Oh, and 
pleats are being worn again, with rows of deep braid,” etc. 

What the others thought I know not ; what they said, 
if they said anything, I did not comprehend. For me the 
house was bursting, walls seen^ed to cramp and to stifle, the 
roof was j'umping and lifting. Escape was the imperative 
thing — to escape into the open air, to shake off bricks and 
mortar, and to wander in the unfrequented places of the 
earth, the more properly to take in the passion and the 
promise of the giddy situation. 

Nature seemed prim and staid that day, and the globe 
gave no hint that it was flying round a circus ring of its 
own. Could they really be true, I wondered, all those 

99 



100 THE MAGIC RING 

bewildering things I had heard tell of circuses ? Did long- 
tailed ponies really walk on their hind-legs and fire off 
pistols? Was it humanly possible for clowns to perform 
one-half of the bewitching drolleries recorded in history ? 
And how, oh, how dare I venture to believe that, from 
off the backs of creamy Arab steeds, ladies of more 
than earthly beauty discharged themselves through paper 
hoops ? No, it was not altogether possible, there must have 
been some exaggeration. Still, I would be content with 
very little, I would take a low percentage — a very small 
proportion of the circus myth would more than satisfy 
me. But again, even supposing that history were, once in a 
way, no liar, could it be that I myself was really fated to 
look upon this thing in the flesh and to live through it, to 
survive the rapture ? No, it was altogether too much. 
Something was bound to happen, one of us would develop 
measles, the world would blow up with a loud explosion. 
I must not dare, I must not presume, to entertain the 
smallest hope. I must endeavour sternly to think of some- 
thing else. 

Needless to say, I thought, I dreamed of nothing else, 
day or night. Waking, I walked arm-in-arm with a clown, 
and cracked a portentous whip to the brave music of a 
band. Sleeping, I pursued — perched astride of a coal-black 
horse — a princess all gauze and spangles, who always 
managed to keep just one unattainable length ahead. In 
the early morning Harold and I, once fully awake, cross- 
examined each other as to the possibilities of this or that 
arcus tradition, and exhausted the lore long ere the first 
housenuiid was stirring. In this state of exaltation we 
slipped onward to what promised to be a day of all white 
days — ^which brings me right back to my text, that grown-up 
people really ought to be more careful. 

I had known it could never really be ; I had said so to 
myself a dozen times. The vision was too sweetly ethereal 
for embodiment. Yet the pang of the disillusionment was 
none the less keen and sickening, and the pain was as that 
of a corporeal wound. It seemed strange and foreboding, 



THE MAGIC RING loi 

when we entered the breakfast-room, not to find everybody 
cracking whips, jumping over chairs, and whooping in 
ecstatic rehearsal of the wild reality to come. The situation 
became grim and pallid indeed when I caught the expres- 
sions “ garden-party ” and “ my mauve tulle,” and realized 
that they both referred to that very afternoon. And every 
minute, as I sat silent and listened, my heart sank lower and 
lower, descending relentlessly like a clock-weight into my 
boot soles 

Throughout my agony I never dreamed of resorting to a 
direct question, much less a reproach. Even during the 
period of joyful anticipation some fear of breaking the spell 
had kept me from any bald circus talk in the presence of 
them. But Harold, who was built in quite another way, so 
soon as he discerned the drift of theii conversation and heard 
the knell of all his hopes, filled the room with wail and 
clamour of bereavement. The grinning welkin rang with 
” Circus ' ” “ Circus ' ” shook the window-panes ; the 
mocking walls re-echoed “ Circus ! ” Circus he would 
have, and the whole circus, and nothing but the circus. 
No compromise for him, no evasions, no fallacious, un- 
secured promises to pay. He had drawn his cheque on 
the Bank of Expectation, and it had got to be cashed then 
and there ; else he would yell, and yell himself into a fit, 
and come out of it and yell again. Yelling should be his 
profession, his art, his mission, his career. He was qualified, 
he was resolute, and he was in no hurry to retire from the 
business. 

The noisy ones of the world, if they do not always shout 
themselves into the imperial purple, arc sure at least of 
receiving attention. If they cannot sell everything at their 
own price, one thing — silence — must, at any cost, be 
purchased of them. Harold accordingly had to be consoled 
by the employment of every specious fallacy and base-born 
trick known to those whose doom it is to handle children. 
For me their hollow cajolery had no interest, I could pluck 
no consolation out of their bankrupt though prodigal 
pledges. I only waited till that hateful, well-known 



loa THE MAGIC RING 

” Some other time, dear ! ” told me that hope was finally 
dead. Then I left the room without any remark. It made 
It worse — if anything could — to hear that stale, worn-out 
old phrase, still supposed by those dullards to have some 
efficacy. 

To nature, as usual, I drifted by instinct, and there, 
out of the track of humanity, under a friendly hedge-row 
had my black hour unseen. The world was a globe no 
longer, space was no more filled with whirling circuses of 
spheres. That day the old beliefs rose up and asserted 
themselves, and the earth was flat again — ditch-riddled, 
stagnant, and deadly flat. The undeviating roads crawled 
straight and white, elms dressed themselves stiffiy along 
inflexible hedges, all nature, centrifugal no longer, sprawled 
flatly in lines out to its farthest edge, and I felt just like 
walking out to that terminus, and dropping quietly off. 
Then, as I sat there, morosely chewing bits of stick, the 
recollection came back to me of certain fascinating adver- 
tisements I had spelled out in the papers — advertisements 
of great and happy men, owning big ships of tonnage 
running into four figures, who yet craved, to the extent 
of public supplication, for the sympathetic co-operation of 
youths as apprentices. I did not rightly know what 
apprentices might be, nor whether I was yet big enough 
to be styled a youth ; but one thing seemed clear, that, by 
some such means as this, whatever the intervening hard- 
ships, I could eventually visit all the circuses of the world — 
the circuses of merry France and gaudy Spain, of Holland 
and Bohemia, of China and Peru. Here was a plan worth 
thinking out in all its bearings ; for something had 
presently to be done to end this intolerable state of things. 

Midday, and even feeding-time, passed by gloomily 
enough, till a small disturbance occurred which had the 
effect of releasing some of the electricity with which the 
air was charged. Harold, it should be explained, was of a 
very different mental mould, and never brooded, moped, 
nor ate his heart out over any disappointment. One wild 
outburst — one dissolution of a minute into his original

elements of air and water, and tears and outcry — so much 
insulted nature claimed. Then he would pull himself 
together, iron out his countenance with a smile, and adjust 
himself to the new condition of things. 

If the gods are ever grateful to man for anything, it is 
when he is so good as to display a short memory. The 
Olympians were never slow to recognize this quality of 
Harold’s, in which, indeed, their salvation lay, and on this 
occasion their gratitude had taken the practical form of a 
fine fat orange, tough-rinded as oranges of those days were 
wont to be. This he had eviscerated in the good old- 
fashioned manner, by biting out a hole in the shoulder, 
inserting a lump of sugar therein, and then working it 
cannily till the whole soul and body of the orange passed 
glorified through the sugar into lus being. Thereupon, 
filled full of orange-juice and iniquity, he conceived a deadly 
snare. Having deftly patted and squeezed the orange-skin 
till it resumed its original shape, he filled it up with water, 
inserted a fresh lump of sugar in the orifice, and, issuing 
forth, blandly proffered it to me as I sat moodily in the 
doorway dreaming of strange wild circuses under tropic 
skies. 

Such a stale old dodge as this would hardly have taken 
me in at ordinary moments. But Harold had reckoned 
rightly upon the disturbing effect of ill-humour, and had 
guessed, perhaps, that I thirsted for comfort and consola- 
tion, and would not criticize too closely the source from 
which they came. Unthinkingly I grasped the golden fraud 
which collapsed at my touch, and squirted its contents into 
my eyes and over my collar, till the nethermost parts of 
me were damp with the water that had run down my neck. 
In an instant I had Harold down, and, with all the energy 
of which I was capable, devoted myself to grinding his 
head into the gravel ; while he, realizing that the closure 
was applied, and that the time for discussion or argument 
was past, sternly concentrated his powers on kicking me 
in the stomach. 

Some people can never allow events to work themselves

out quietly. At this juncture one of Them swooped down 
on the scene, pouring shrill, misplaced abuse on both of 
us : on me for ill-treating my younger brother, whereas it 
was distinctly I who was the injured and the deceived ; on 
him for the high offence of assault and battery on a clean 
collar — a collar which I had myself deflowered and defaced, 
shortly before, in sheer desperate ill-temper. Disgusted 
and defiant we fled in different directions, rejoining each 
other later in the kitchen-garden ; and as we strolled along 
together, our short feud forgotten, Harold observed, 
gloomily : “ I should like to be a cave-man, like Uncle 
George was tellin’ us about : with a flint hatchet and no 
clothes, and live in a cave and not know anybody ! ” 

“ And if any one came to see us we didn’t like,” I joined 
in, catching on to the points of the idea, “ we’d hit him 
on the head with the hatchet till he dropped down dead.” 

“ And then,” said Harold, warming up, ” we’d drag 
him into the cave and skin him * ” 

For a space we gloated silently over the fair scene 
our imaginations had conjured up. It was blood we felt 
the need of just then. We wanted no luxuries, nothing 
dear-bought nor far-fetched. Just plain blood, and nothing 
else, and plenty of it 

Blood, however, was not to be had. The time was out 
of joint, and we had been born too late. So we went off 
to the greenhouse, crawled into the heating arrangement 
underneath, and played at the dark and dirty and un- 
restricted life of cave-men till we were heartily sick of it. 
Then we emerged once more into historic times, and went 
off to the road to look for something living and sentient to 
throw stones at. 

Nature, so often a cheerful ally, sometimes sulks and 
refuses to play. When in this mood she passes the word 
to her underlings, and all the little people of fur and 
feather take the hint and slip home quietly by back streets. 
In vain we scouted, lurked, crept, and ambuscaded. 
Everything that usually scurried, hopped, or fluttered — 
the small society of the undergrowth — seemed to have 



THE MAGIC RING 


105 

engagements elsewhere. The horrid thought that perhaps 
they had all gone off to the cu-cus occurred to us simultane- 
ously, and we humped ourselves up on the fence and felt 
bad. Even the sound of approaching wheels failed to stir 
any interest in us. When you are bent on throwing stones 
at something, humanity seems obtrusive and better away. 
Then suddenly we both jumped off the fence together, our 
faces clearing For our educated ear had told us that the 
approaching rattle could only proceed from a dog-cart, 
and we felt sure it must be the funny man. 

We called him the funny man because he was sad and 
serious, and said little, but gazed right into our souls, and 
made us tell him just what was on our minds at the time, 
and then came out with some magnificently luminous 
suggestion that cleared every cloud away. What was 
more, he would then go off wilh us at once and play the 
thing right out to its finish, earnestly and devotedly, putting 
all other things aside So we called him the funny man, 
meaning only that he was different from those others who 
thought it incumbent on them to play the painful mummer. 
The ideal as opposed to the real man was what we meant, 
only we were not acquainted with the phrase. Those 
others, with their laboured jests and clumsy contortions, 
doubtless flattered themselves, that they were lunny men ; 
we, who had to sit through and applaud the painful 
performance, knew better 

He pulled up to a walk as soon as he caught sight of us, 
and the dog-cart crawled slowly along till it stopped just 
opposite. Then he leant his chin on his hand and regarded 
us long and soulfully, yet said he never a word ; while we 
jigged up and down in the dust, grinning bashfully but 
with expectation. For you never knew exactly what this 
man might say or do. 

“ You look bored,” he remarked presently j “ thoroughly 
bored. Or else — ^let me see ; you’re not married, are 
you ?” 

He asked this in such sad earnestness that we hastened 
to assure him we were not married, though v?e felt he 



io6 THE MAGIC RING 

ought to have known that much ; we had been intimate 
for some time. 

“ Then it’s only boredom,” he said. “Just satiety and 
world- weariness. Well, if you assure me you aren’t married 
you can climb into this cart and I’ll take you for a drive. 
I’m bored, too. I want to do something dark and dreadful 
and exciting.” 

We clambered in, of course, yapping with delight and 
treading all over his toes ; and as we set off, Harold 
demanded of him imperiously whither he was going. 

“ My wife,” he replied, “ has ordered me to go and look 
up the curate and Iiring him home to tea. Does that sound 
sufficiently exciting for you ? ” 

Our faces fell. The curate of tlie hour was not a success, 
from our point of view. He was not a funny man, in any 
sense of the word. 

“ — but I’m not going to,” he added cheerfully. “ Then 
I was to stop at some cottage and ask — ^what was it ^ 
There was nettle-rash mixed up in it. I’m sure. But never 
mind, I’ve forgotten, and it doesn’t matter Look here, 
we’re three desperate young fellows who stick at nothing. 
Suppose we go off to the circus ? ” 

Of certain supreme moments it is not easy to write. 
The varying shades and currents of emotion may indeed 
be put into words by those specially skilled that way ; they 
often are, at considerable length. But the sheer, crude 
article itself — the strong, live thing that leaps up inside you 
and swells and strangles you, the di/ziness of revulsion that 
takes the breath like cold water — ^who shall depict this and 
live ? All I knew was that I would have died then and 
there, cheerfully, for the funny man ; that I longed for 
Red Indians to spring out from the hedge on the dog-cart, 
just to show what I would do ; and that, with all this, I 
could not find the least little word to say to him. 

Harold was less taciturn. With shrill voice, uplifted in 
solemn chant, he sang the great spheral circus-song and the 
undying glory of the Ring. Of its timeless beginning he 
sang, of its fashioning by cosmic forces, and of its harmony 



THE MAGIC RING 


107 

with the stellar plan. Of horses he sang, of their strength, 
their swiftness, and their docility as to tricks. Of clowns 
again, of glory, of knavery, and of the eternal type that 
shall endure. Lastly he sang of Her — the Woman of the 
Ring — flawless, complete, untrammelled in each subtly 
curving limb ; earth’s highest output. Time’s noblest 
expression. At least, he doubtless sang all these things and 
more — he certainly seemed to ; though all that was 
distinguishable was, “ We’re-goin’-to-the-circus ! ” and 
then once more, “ We’re-goin’-to-the-circus ! ” — the sweet 
rhythmic phrase repeated again and again. But indeed 
I cannot be quite sure, for I heard confusedly, as in a 
dream. Wings of fire sprang from the old mare’s shoulders 
We whirled on our way through purple elouds, and earth 
and the rattle of wheels were far away below. 

The dream and the dizziness were still in my head when 
I found myself, scarce conscious of intermediate steps, 
seated actually in the circus at last, and ♦ook in the first 
sniff of that intoxicating circus smell that will stay by me 
while this clay endures. The place was beset by a hum 
and a glitter and a mist ; suspense brooded large o’er the 
blank, mysterious arena. Strung up to the highest pitch of 
expectation, we knew not from what quarter, in what divine 
shape, the first surprise would come. 

A thud of unseen hoofs first set us a-quiver ; then a 
crash of cymbals, a jangle of bells, a hoarse applauding 
roar, and Coralie was in the midst of us, whirling past 
’twixt earth and sky, now erect, flushed, radiant, now 
crouched to the flowing mane ; swung and tossed and 
moulded by the maddening dance-music of the band. 
The mighty whip of the count in the frock-coat marked time 
with pistol-shots ; his war-cry, whooping clear above the 
music, fired the blood with a passion for splendid deeds, 
as Coralie, laughing, exultant, crashed through the paper 
hoops. We gripped the red cloth in front of us, and our 
souls sped round and round with Coralie, leaping with her, 
prone with her, swung by mane or tail with her. It was not 
only the ravishment of her delirious feats, nor her cream- 



,o8 THE MAGIC RING 

coloured horse of fairy breed, long-tailed, roe-footed, an 
enchanted prince surely, if ever there was one ! It was 
her more than mortal beauty — displayed, too, under con- 
ditions never vouchsafed to us before — that held us spell- 
bound What princess had arms so dazzlingly white, or 
went delicately clothed in such pink and spangles ^ Hither- 
to we had known the outward woman as but a drab thing, 
hour-glass shaped, nearly legless, bunched here, constricted 
there , slow of movement, and given to deprecating lusty 
action of limb. Here was a revelation ! From henceforth 
our imaginations would have to be revised and corrected 
up to date In one of those swift rushes the mind makes in 
high-strung moments, I saw myscll and Coralie, close 
enfolded, pacing the world together, o’er hill and plain, 
through storied cities, past rows of applauding relations, — 
I in my Sunday knickerbockers, she in her pink and 
spangles 

Summers sicken, flowers fail and die, all beauty but 
rides round the ring and out at the portal ; even so Coralie 
passed in her turn, poised sideways, panting, on her steed ; 
lightly swayed as a tulip-bloom, bowing on this side and 
on that as she disappeared ; and with her went my heart 
and my soul, and all the light and the glory and the 
entrancoment of the scene. 

Harold woke up with a gasp “ Wasn’t she beautiful ? ” 
he said, in quite a subdued way for hi m I felt a momentary 
pang. We had been friendly rivals before in many an 
exploit ; but here was altogether a more serious affair. 
Was this, then, to be the beginning of strife and coldness, 
of civil war on the hearthstone, and the sundering of old 
ties ? Then I recollected the true position of things, and 
felt very sorry for Harold ; for it was inexorably written 
that he would have to give way to me, since I was the elder. 
Rules were not made for nothing, in a sensibly constructed 
universe. 

There was little more to wait for, now Coralie had gone ; 
yet I lingered still, on the chance of her appearing again. 
Next moment the clown tripped up and fell flat, with 



THE MAGIC RING 109 

magnificent artifice, and at once fresh emotions began to 
stir. Love had endured its little hour, and stern ambition 
now asserted itself. Oh, to be a splendid fellow like this, 
self-contained, ready of speech, agile beyond conception, 
braving the forces of society, his hand against every one, 
yet always getting the best of it ! What freshness of humour, 
what courtesy to dames, what triumphant ability to dis- 
comfit rivals, frock-coated and moustached though they 
might be ! And what a grand, self-confident straddle of 
the legs ! Who could desire a finer career than to go 
through life thus gorgeously equipped ! Success was bis 
key-note, adroitness his panoply, and the mellow music 
of laughter his instant reward. Even Coralie’s image 
wavered and receded I would come back to her in the 
evening, of course ; but I would be a clown all the working 
hours of the day 

The short interval was ended : the band, with long- 
drawn chords, sounded a prelude touched with signifi- 
cance ; and tbe programme, in letters over-topping their 
fellows, proclaimed Zephyrine, the Bride of the Desert, 
in her unequalled bareback equestrian interlude. So 
sated was I already with beauty and w.th wit, that I hardly 
dared hope for a fresh emotion. Yet her title was tinged 
with romance, and Coralie’s display had aroused in me 
an interest in her sex which even herself had failed to satisfy 
entirely. 

Brayed in by trumpets, Zephyrine swung passionately 
into the arena. With a bound she stood erect, one foot 
upon each of her supple, plunging Arabs ; and at once I 
knew that my fate was sealed, my chapter closed, and the 
Bride of the Desert was the one bride for me. Black was her 
raiment, great silver stars shone through it, caught in the 
dusky twilight of her gauze ; black as her own hair were 
the two mighty steeds she bestrode. In a tempest they 
thundered bv, in a whirlwind, a scirocco of tan ; her 
cheeks bore the kiss of an Eastern sun, and the sand-storms 
of her native desert were her satellites. What was Coralie, 
with her pink silk, her golden hair and slender limbs. 



no THE MAGIC RING 

beside this magnificent, full-figured Cleopatra? In a 
twinkling we were scouring the desert — she and I and the 
two coal-black horses. Side by side, keeping pace in our 
swinging gallop, we distanced the ostrich, we outstrode 
the zebra ; and, as we went, it seemed the wilderness 
blossomed like the rose. 


I know not rightly how we got home that evening On 
the road there were everywhere strange presences, and the 
thud of phantom hoofs encircled us In my nose was the 
pungent circus-smell ; the crack of the whip and the frank 
laugh of the clown were in my ears. The funny man 
thoughtfully abstained fiom conversation, and left our 
illusion quite alone, sparing us all jarring criticism and 
analysis ; and he gave me no chance, when he deposited 
us at our gale, to get rid of the clumsy expressions of grati- 
tude I had been laboriously framing. For the rest of the 
evening, distraught and silent, I only heard the march- 
music of the band, playing on in some corner of my brain. 
When at last my head touched the pillow, in a trice I was 
with Zephyrine, riding the boundless Sahara, cheek to 
cheek, the world well lost ; while at times, through the 
sand-clouds that encircled us, glimmered the eyes of Coralie, 
touched, one fancied, with something of a tender reproach. 



A SAGA OF THE SEAS 


I T happened one day that some ladies came to call, 
who were not at all the sort I was used to. They 
suffered from a grievance, so far as I could gather, and the 
burden of their plaint was Man — Men in general and 
Man in particular (Though the words were but spoken, 
I could clearly discern the capital M in their acid utterance.) 

Of course I was not present officially, so to speak. Down 
below, in my sub-world of chair-legs and hearthrugs and 
the undersides of sofas, I was woiking out my own floor- 
problems, while they babbled on far above my head, con- 
sidering me as but a chair-leg, or even something lower in 
the scale. Yet I was listening hard all the time, with that 
respectful consideration one gives to all gi own-up people’s 
remarks, so long as one knows no better. 

It seemed a serious indictment enough, as they rolled it 
out. In tact, considerateness, and right appreciation, as 
well as in taste and esthetic sensibihtics — we failed at every 
point, we breeched and bearded prentice-jobs of Nature ; 
and I began to feel like collapsing on the carpet from sheer 
spiritual antemia. But when one of them, with a swing of 
her skirt, prostrated a whole regiment of my brave tin 
soldiers, and never apologized nor even offered her aid 
toward revivifying the battle-line, I could not help feeling 
that in tactfulness and consideration for otheis she was still 
a little to seek. And I said as much, with some directness 
of language. 

That was the end of me, from a society point of view. 
Rudeness to visitors was the unpardonable sin, and in two 
seconds I had my marching orders, and was sullenly wend- 
ing my way to the St. Helena of the nursery. As I climbed 
the stair, my thoughts reverted somehow to a game we 


III 



1 12 A SAGA OF THE SEAS 

had been playing that very morning. It was the good old 
game of Rafts, — a game that will be played till all the oceans 
are dry and all the trees in the world are felled — and after 
And we were all crowded together on the precarious little 
platform, and Selina occupied every bit as much room as 
I did, and Charlotte’s legs didn’t dangle over any more 
than Harold’s. The pitiless sun overhead beat on us all 
with tropic impartiality, and the hungry sharks, whose 
fins scored the limitless Pacific stretching out on every side, 
were impelled by an appetite that made no exceptions as 
to sex. When we shared the ultimate biscuit and circulated 
the last water-keg, the girls got an absolute fourth apiece, 
and neither more nor less ; and the only partiality shown 
was entirely in favour of Charlotte, who was allowed to 
perceive and to hail the saviour-sail on the horizon. And 
this was only because it was her turn to do so, not because 
she happened to be this or that. Surely, the rules of the 
raft were the rules of life, and in what, then, did these 
visitor-ladies’ grievance consist? 

Puzzled and a little sulky, I pushed open the door of the 
deserted nursery, where the raft that had rocked beneath 
so many hopes and fears still occupied the ocean-floor. 
To the dull eye, that merely tarries upon the outsides of 
things. It might have appeared unromantic and even 
unraftlike, consisting only as it did of a round sponge-bath 
on a bald deal towel-horse placed flat on the floor. Even 
to myself much of the recent raft-glamour seemed to have 
departed as I half-mechanically stepped inside and curled 
myself up in it for a solitary voyage. Once I was in, how- 
ever, the old magic and mystery returned in full flood, when 
I discovered ihat the inequalities of the towel-horse caused 
the bath to rock, slighUy, indeed, but easily and incessantly. 
A few minutes of this delightful motion, and one was fairly 
launched. So those women below didn’t want us ? Well, 
there were other women and other places, that did. And 
this was going to be no scrambling raft-affair, but a full- 
blooded voyage of the Man, equipped and purposeful, 
in search of what was his rightful own. 



A SAGA OP THE SEAS 113 

Whither should I shape my course, and what sort of 
vessel should I charter for the voyage ? The shipping of all 
England was mine to pick from, and the far corners of the 
globe were my rightful inheritance. A frigate, of course, 
seemed the natural vehicle for a boy of spirit to set out in. 
And yet there was something rather “ uppish ” in com- 
manding a frigate at the very first set-off, and little spread 
was left for the ambition. Frigates, too, could always be 
acquired later by sheer adventure ; and your real hero 
generally saved up a square-rigged ship for the final 
achievement and the rapt return. No, it was a schooner 
that I was aboard of — a schooner whose masts raked devil- 
ishly as the leaping seas hissed along her low black gun- 
wale. Many hare-brained youths started out on a mere 
cutter ; but I was prudent, and besides I had some inkling 
of the serious affairs that were ahead. 

I have said I was already on board ; and, indeed, on 
this occasion I was too hungry for adventure to linger over 
what would have been a special delight at a period of more 
leisure — the dangling about the harbour, the choosing your 
craft, selecting your shipmates, stowing your cargo, and 
fitting up your private cabin with everything you might 
want to put your hand on in any emergency whatever. I 
could not wait for that. Out beyond soundings the big 
seas were racing westward and calling me, albatrosses 
hovered motionless, expectant of a comrade, and a thousand 
islands held each of them a fresh adventure, stored up, 
hidden away, awaiting production, expressly saved for me. 
We were humming, close-hauled, down the Channel, 
spray in the eyes and the shrouds thrilling musically, in 
much less time than the average man would have taken to 
transfer his Gladstone bag and his rugs from the train to a 
sheltered place on the promenade-deck of the tame daily 
steamer. 

So long as we were in pilotage I stuck manfully to the 
wheel. The undertaking was mine, and with it all its 
responsibilities, and there was some tricky steering to be 
done as we sped by headland and bay, ere we breasted the 
8 



114 A SAGA OF THE SEAS 

great seas outside and the land fell away behind us. But 
as soon as the Atlantic had opened out I began to feel that 
it would be rather nice to t^e tea by myself in my own 
cabin, and it therefore became necessary to invent a 
comrade or two, to take their turn at the wheel. 

This was easy enough A friend or two of my own age, 
from among the boys I knew ; a friend or two from 
characters in the books I knew ; and a friend or two from 
No-man’s-land, where every fellow’s a born sailor ; and 
the crew was complete. I addressed them on the poop, 
divided them into watches, gave instructions I should 
be summoned on the first sign of pirates, whales, or 
Frenchmen, and retired below to a well-eained spell of 
relaxation. 

That was the right sort of cabin that I stepped into, 
shutting the dooi behind me with a click. Of course, fire- 
ainis were the first thing I looked for, and there they were, 
sure enough, in their racks, dozens of ’em — double-barrelled 
guns, and rcpeating-riflcs, and long pistols, and shiny 
plated levolvers. I rang up the steward and ordered tea, 
with scones, and jam in its native pots — none of your finick- 
ing shallow glass dishes ; and, when properly streaked with 
j'am, and blown out w'lth tea, I w'ent through the armoury, 
clicked the rifles and revolveis, tested the edges of the cut- 
lasses with my thumb, and filled the cartiidge-belts chock- 
full Everything was there, and of the best quality, just 
as if I had spent a whole fortnight knocking about Plymouth 
and ordering things. Clearly, if this ciuise came to grief, 
it would not be for want of equipment. 

Just as I was beginning on the lockers and the drawers, 
the watch reported icebcigs on both bows — and, what was 
more to the point, coveys of Polar bears on the icebergs. 
1 grasped a rifle or two, and hastened on deck. The spec- 
tacle w'as indeed magnificent — ^it generally is, with icebergs 
on both bows, and these were exceptionally enormous ice- 
bergs. But I hadn’t come there to paint Academy pictures, 
so the captain’s gig was in the water and manned almost 
ere the boatswain’s whistle had ceased sounding, and we 



A SAGA OF THE SEAS 115 

were pulling hard for the Polar bears — myself and the rifles 
in the stern-sheets. 

I have rarely enjoyed better shooting than I got during 
that afternoon’s tramp over the icebergs. Perhaps I was 
in specially good form ; perhaps the bears “ rose ” well. 
Anyhow, the bag was a portentous one. In later days, on 
reading of the growing scarcity of Polar bears, my con- 
science has pricked me , but that afternoon I experienced 
no compunction. Nevertheless, when the huge pile of skins 
had been hoisted on board, and a stiff grog had been served 
out to the crew of the captain’s gig, I ordered the schooner’s 
head to be set due south. For icebergs were played out, 
for the moment, and it was getting to be time for something 
more tropical. 

Tiopical was a mild expression of what was to come, as 
was shortly proved. It w'as about three bells in the next 
day’s forenoon watch when the look-out man first sighted 
the piiate brigantine. I dishkcd the looks of her from the 
first, and, after piping all hands to quarlcis, had the brass 
carronade on the fore-deck crammed with grape to the 
murzlc. 

This proved a wise precaution. For the flagitious pirate 
craft, having crept up to us under the colours of the Swiss 
Republic, a Stale with which we were just then on the 
best possible terms, suddenly shook out the skull-and-cross- 
bones at her masthead, and let fly with round-shot at close 
quarters, knocking into pieces several of my crew, who could 
ill be spared The sight of their disconnected limbs aroused 
my ire to its utmost height, and I let them have the contents 
of the brass carronade, with ghastly effect. Next moment 
the hulls of the two ships were gnnding together, the cold 
steel flashed from its scabbard, and the death-grapple had 
begun 

In spite of the deadly work of my grape-gorged carron- 
adc, our foe still outnumbered us, I reckoned, by three to 
one. Honour forbade my fixing it at a lower figure — 
this was the minimum rate at which one dared to do busi- 
ness with pirates. They were stark veterans, too, every man 



ii6 A SAGA OF THE SEAS 

seamed with ancient sabre-cuts, whereas my crew had many 
of them hardly attained the maturity which is the gift of 
ten long summers — and the whole thing was so sudden 
that I had no time to invent a reinforcement of riper years. 
It was not surprising, therefore, that my dauntless boarding- 
party, axe in hand and cutlass between teeth, fought their 
way to the pirates’ deck only to be repulsed again and yet 
again, and that our planks were soon slippery with our own 
ungrudged and inexhaustible blood. At this critical 
point in the conflict, the bo’sun, grasping me by the arm, 
drew my attention to a magmficent British man-of-war, 
just hove-to in the ofling, while the signalman, his glass at 
his eye, repoi ted that she was inquiring whether wc wanted 
any assistanee or preferred to go through with the little 
job ourselves 

This veiled attempt to share our laurels with us, cour- 
teously as It was worded, put me on my mettle Wiping 
the blood out of my eyes, 1 ordered the signalman to reply 
instantly, with the half-dozen or so of flags that he had at 
his disposal, that much as we appreciated the valoui of the 
regular service, and the delicacy of spirit that animated its 
commanders, still this was an orthodox case of the young 
gentleman-adventurer verstu the unshaved pirate, and Her 
Majesty’s Mai me had nothing to do but to form the usual 
admiring and applauding background. Then, rallying 
round me the remnant of my faithful ciew, I selected a 
fresh cutlass (I had worn out three already) and plunged 
once more into the pleasing carnage. 

The result was not long doubtful. Indeed, I could not 
allow It to be, as I was already getting somewhat bored 
with the pirate business, and was wanting to get on to 
something more southern and sensuous. All serious resist- 
ance came to an end as soon as I had reached the quarter- 
deck and cut down the pirate chief — a fine black-bearded 
fellow in his way, but hardly up to date in his parry-and- 
thrust business. Those whom our cutlasses had spared were 
marched out along their own plank, in the approved old 
fashion ; and in ume the scuppers relieved the decks of the 



A SAGA OF THE SEAS 117 

blood that made traffic temporarily impossible. And all 
the time the British man-of-war admired and applauded 
in the offing. 

As soon as we had got through with the necessary throat- 
cutting and swabbing-up, all hands set to work to discover 
treasure ; and soon the deck shone bravely with ingots 
and Mexican dollars and church plate. There were ropes 
of pearls, too, and big stacks of nougat ; and rubies, and 
gold watches, and Turkish Delight in tubs But I left 
these trifles to my crew, and continued the search alone. 
For by this time I had determined that there should be a 
Princess on board carried off to be sold in captivity to 
the bold bad Moors, and now with beating heart awaidng 
her rescue by me, the Peiseus of her dreams. 

I came upon her at last in the big state-cabin in the 
stern ; and she wore a holland pinafore over her Princess- 
clothes, and she had brown wavy hair, hanging down her 
back, just like — well, never mind, she had brown wavy hair 
When gentle-folk meet, courtesies pass ; and I will not 
weary other people with relating all the compliments and 
counter-compliments that we exchanged, all in the most 
approved manner Occasions, like this, when tongues 
wagged smoothly and speech flowed free, were alwajs 
especially pleasing to me, who am naturally inclined to 
be tongue-tied with women But at last ceremony was 
over, and we sat on the table and swung our legs and 
agreed to be fast friends. And I showed her my latest 
knife — one-bladed, horn-handled, terrific, hung round my 
neck with string ; and she showed me the chiefest treasures 
the ship contained, hidden away in a most private and 
particular locker — a musical box with a glass top that let 
you see the works, and a railway tram with real lines and 
a real tunnel, and a tin iron-clad that followed a magnet, 
and was ever so much handier in many respects than the 
real full-sized thing that still lay and applauded in the offing. 

There was high feasting that night in my cabin. We 
invited the captain of the man-of-war — one could hardly 
do less, it seemed to me — and the Princess took one end 



ii8 A SAGA OF THE SEAS 

of the table and I took the other, and the captain was 
very kind and nice, and told us fairy-stories, and asked us 
both to come and stay with him next Christmas, and 
promised we should have some hunting, on real ponies. 
When he left I gave him some ingots and things, and saw 
him into his boat ; and then I went round the ship and 
addressed the crew in several set speeches, which moved 
them deeply, and with my own hands loaded up the 
carronade with grape-shot till it ran over at the mouth. 
This done, I retired into the cabin with the Princess, and 
locked the door And first we started the musical box, 
taking turns to wind it up ; and then we made tolTee in 
the cabin-stove , and then we ran the train round and 
round the room, and through and through the tunnel ; 
and lastly we swam the tin ironclad in the bath, with the 
soap-dish for a piiatc 

Next morning the aii was rich with spices, porpoises 
rolled and gambolled round the bows, and the South 
Sea Islands lay full in view (they were the real South 
Sea Islands, of course — not the badly furnished journey- 
mcn-islands that are to be perceived on the map) As 
for the pirate biigantine and the man-of-war, I don’t really 
know what became of them They had played their part 
very well, for the time, but I wasn’t going to bother to 
account for them, so I just let them evaporate quietly. The 
islands provided plenty of fresh occupation. For here 
were little bays of silvery sand, dotted with land-crabs ; 
groves of palm-trees wherein monkeys fiisked and pelted 
each other with coco-nuts ; and caves and sites for stock- 
ades, and hidden treasures significantly indicated by skulls, 
in riotous plenty ; while birds and beasts of every colour 
and all latitudes made pleasing noises which excited the 
sporting instinct. 

The islands lay conveniently close together, which 
necessitated careful steering as we threaded the devious 
and intricate channels that separated them. Of course 
no one else could be trusted at the wheel, so it is not 
surprising that for some time I quite forgot that there was 



A SAGA OF THE SEAS 119 

such a thing as a Princess on board. This is too much the 
masculine way, whenever there’s any real business doing. 
However, I remembered her as soon as the anchor was 
dropped, and I went below and consoled her, and we had 
breakfast together, and she was allowed to “ pour out,” 
which quite made up for everything When breakfast 
was over we ordered out the captain’s gig, and rowed all 
about the islands, and paddled, and ex:plored, and hunted 
bisons and beetles and butterflies, and found everything 
we wanted. And I gave her pink shells and tortoises and 
great milky pearls and little gieen lizards ; and she gave 
me guinea-pigs, and coral to make into waistcoat-buttons, 
and tame sea-otters, and a real pirate’s powder-horn. 
It was a prolific day and a long-lasting one, and weary 
were we with all our hunting and our getting and our 
gathering, when at last we clambeied into the captain’s 
gig and rowed back to a late tea 

The following day my conscience rose up and accused 
me. This was not what I had come out to do. These 
triflings with pearls and parrakeets, these al fresco luncheons 
off yams and bananas — there was no “ making of history ” 
about them. I resolved that without further dallying I 
would turn to and capture the French frigate, according 
to the original programme. So we upped anchor with the 
morning tide, and set all sail for San Salvador. 

Of course I had no idea where San Salvador really was. 
I haven’t now, for that matter. But it seemed a right- 
sounding sort of name for a place that was to have a bay 
that was to hold a French frigate that was to be cut out ; 
so, as I said, we sailed for San Salvador and made the bay 
about eight bells that evening, and saw the top-masts of 
the frigate over the headland that sheltered her. And forth- 
with there was summoned a Council of War. 

It is a very serious matter, a Council of War. We had 
not held one hitherto, pirates and truck of that sort not 
calling for such solemn treatment. But in an aflfair that 
might almost be called international, it seemed well to 
proceed gravely and by regular steps. So we met in my 



120 A SAGA OF THE SEAS 

cabin — the Princess, and the bo’sun, and a boy from the 
real-life lot, and a man from among the book-men, and a 
fellow from No-man ’s-land, and myself in the chair. 

The bo’sun had taken part in so many cuttings-out 
during his past career that practically he did all the talking, 
and was the Council of War himself. It was to be an affair 
of boats, he explained. A boat’s-crew would be told off to 
cut the cables, and two boat’s-crews to climb stealthily 
on board and overpower the sleeping Frenchmen, and two 
more boats’-crews to haul the doomed vessel out of the 
bay. This made rather a demand on my limited resources 
as to crews ; but I was prepared to stretch a point in a case 
like this, and I speedily brought my numbers up to the 
requisite efficiency. 

The night was both moonless and starless — I had 
arranged all that — when the boats pushed off from the side 
of our vessel, and made their way toward the ship that, 
unfortunately for itself, had been singled out by Fate to 
carry me home in triumph. I was in excellent spirits, and, 
indeed, as I stepped over the side, a lawless idea crossed 
my mind, of discovering another Princess on board the 
frigate — a French one this time ; I had heard that sort was 
rather nice. But 1 abandoned the notion at once, recollect- 
ing that the heroes of all history had always been noted 
for their unswerving constancy. 

The French captain was snug in bed when I clambered 
in through his cabin window and held a naked cutlass to his 
throat. Naturally he was surprised and considerably 
alarmed, till I discharged one of my set speeches at him, 
pointing out that my men already had his crew under 
hatchway, that his vessel was even then being towed out 
of harbour, and that, on his accepting the situation with a 
good grace, his person and private property would be 
treated with all the respect due to the representative of a 
great nation for which I entertained feelings of the pro- 
foundest admiration and regard and all that sort ot thing. 
It was a beautiful speech. The Frenchman at once 
presented me with his parole, in the usual way, and, in a 



A SAGA OF THE SEAS lai 

reply of some power and pathos, only begged that I would 
retire a moment while he put on his trousers. This I 
gracefully consented to do, and the incident ended. 

Two of my boats were sunk by the fire from the forts 
on the shore, and several brave fellows were severely 
wounded in the hand-to-hand struggle with the French 
crew for the possession of the frigate. But the bo’sun’s 
admirable strategy, and my own reckless gallantry in 
securing the French captain at the outset, had the fortunate 
result of keeping down the death-rate. It was all for the 
sake of the Princess that I had arranged so comparatively 
tame a victory. For myself, I rather liked a fair amount 
of blood-letting, red-hot shot, and flying splinters. But 
when you have girls about the place, they have got to be 
considered to a certain extent. 

There was another supper-party that night, in my cabin, 
as soon as we had got well out to sea ; and the French 
captain, who was the guest of the evening, was in the 
greatest possible form. We became svsorn friends, and 
exchanged invitations to come and stay at each other’s 
homes, and really it was quite difficult to induce him to take 
his leave. But at last he and his crew were bundled into 
their boats ; and after I had pressed some pirate bullion 
upon them — delicately, of course, but in a pleasant manner 
that admitted of no denial — ^the gallant fellows quite broke 
down, and we parted, our bosoms heaving with a full sense 
of each other’s magnanimity and good-fellowship. 

The next day, which was nearly all taken up with shifting 
our quarters into the new frigate, so honourably and easily 
acquired, was a very pleasant one, as every one who has 
gone up in the world and moved into a larger house will 
readily understand. At last I had grim, black guns all 
along each side, instead of a rotten brass carronade ; at 
last I had a square-rigged ship, with real yards, and a 
proper quarter-deck. In fact, now that I had soared as high 
as could be hoped in a single voyage, it seemed about time 
to go home and cut a dash and show off a bit. The worst 
of this ocean-theatre was, it held no proper audience. It 



122 A SAGA OF THE SEAS 

was hard, of course, to relinquish all the adventures that 
still lay untouched in these Southern seas. Whaling, for 
instance, had not yet been entered upon ; the joys of 
exploration and strange inland cities innocent of the white 
man, still awaited me ; and the book of wrecks and rescues 
was not yet even opened. But I had achieved a frigate and 
a Princess, and that was not so bad for a beginning and 
more than enough to show off with before those dull un- 
adventurous folk who continued on their mill-horse round 
at home. 

The voyage home was a record one, so far as mere speed 
was concerned, and all adventures were scornfully left 
behind, as we rattled along, for other adventurers who had 
still their laurels to win. Hardly later than the noon of 
next day we dropped anchor in Plymouth Sound, and 
heard the intoxicating clamour of bells, the roar of artillery, 
and the hoarse cheers of an excited populace surging down 
to the quays, that told us we were being appreciated at 
something like our true mcnts The Lord Mayor was wait- 
ing theie to receive us, and with him several Admirals of 
the Fleet, as we walked down the lane of pushing, enthusi- 
astic Devonians, the Princess and I, and our war-worn, 
weather-beaten, spoil-laden crew. Everybody was very 
nice about the French ft igate, and the pirate booty, and the 
scars still fresh on our young limbs ; yet I think what I 
liked best of all was that they all pronounced the Princess 
to be a duck, and a peerless, brown-haired darling, and a 
true mate for a hero, and of the right Princess-breed 

The air was thick with invitations and with the smell of 
civic banquets in a forward stage ; but I sternly waved all 
festivities aside. The coaches-and-four I had ordered 
immediately on arriving were blocking the whole of the 
High Street ; the champing of bits and the pawing of 
gravel summoned us to take our seats and be off, to where 
the real performance awaited us, compaied with which all 
this was but an interlude. I placed the Princess in the 
most highly gilded coach of the lot, and mounted to my 
place at her side ; and the rest of the crew scrambled on 



A SAGA OF THE SEAS 123 

board the others as best they might. The whips cracked 
and the crowd scattered and cheered as we broke into a 
gallop for home. The noisy bells burst into a farewell peal — 
Yes, that was undoubtedly the usual bell for school-room 
tea. And high time too, I thought, as I tumbled out of the 
bath, which was beginning to feel very hard to the pro- 
jecting portions of my frame-work. As I trotted downstairs, 
hungrier even than usual, farewells floated up from the 
front door, and I heard the departing voices of our angular 
elderly visitors as they made their way down the walk. 
Man was still catching it, apparently — Man was getting 
it hot. And much Man cared ! The seas were his, and 
their islands ; he had his frigates for the taking, his pirates 
and their hoards for an unregarded cutlass-stroke or two ; 
and there were Princesses in plenty waiting for him 
somewhere — Princesses of the right sort. 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


F ootprints in the snow have been unfailing 
provokers of sentiment ever since snow was first a 
white wonder in this drab-coloured world of ours. In a 
poetry-book presented to one of us by an aunt, there was a 
poem by one Wordsworth in which they stood out strongly 
with a picture all to themselves, too — but we didn’t think 
very highly either of the jioem or the sentiment. Foot- 
prints in the sand, now, were quite another matter, and 
we grasped Crusoe’s attitude of mind much more easily 
than Wordsworth’s Excitement and mystery, curiosity 
and suspense — these were the only sentiments that tracks, 
whether in sand or in snow, w'ere able to arouse in us. 

We had awakened early that winter morning, puzzled 
at first by the added light that filled the room Then, when 
the truth at last fully dawned on us and we knew that 
snow-balling was no longer a wistful dream, but a solid 
certainty waiting for us, outside, it w'as a mere brute fight 
for the necessary clothes, and the lacing of boots seemed a 
clumsy invention, and the buttoning of coats an unduly 
tedious form of fastening, with all that snow going to waste 
at our very door. 

When dinner-time came we had to be dragged in by 
the scruff of our necks The short armistice over, the 
combat w'as resumed , but presently Charlotte and I, 
a little weary of contests and of missiles that ran shudder- 
ingly down inside one’s clothes, forsook thc^trampled battle- 
field of the lawn and w'ent exploring the blank virgin spaces 
of the white world that lay beyond. It stretched away 
unbroken on every side of us, this mysterious soft garment 
under which our familiar world had so suddenly hidden 
itself. Faint imprints showed where a casual bird had 

124 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


125 

alighted, but of other traffic there was next to no 
sign ; which made these strange tracks all the more 
puzzling. 

We came across them first at the corner of the shrubbery, 
and pored over them long, our hands on our knees. Ex- 
perienced trappers that we knew ourselves to be, it was 
annoying to be brought up suddenly by a beast we could 
not at once identify. 

“ Don’t you know ? ” said Charlotte rather scornfully. 
“ Thought you knew all the beasts that ever was ” 

This put me on my mettle, and I hastily rattled off a 
string of animal names embracing both the arctic and the 
tropic zones, but without much real confidence. 

“ No,” said Charlotte, on consideration ; “ they won’t 
any of ’em quite do. Seems like something hzardy. Did 
you say a iguanodon ? Might be that, p’raps. But that’s 
not British, and we want a real British beast. J think it’s a 
dragon ! ” 

“ ’Tisn’t half big enough,” I objected 

“ Well, all dragons must be small to begin with,” said 
Charlotte • “ like everything else. P’raps this is a little 
dragon who’s got lost. A little dragon would be rather 
nice to have. He might scratch and spit, but he couldn’t 
do anything really. Let’s track him down ! ” 

So we set off into the wide snow-clad world, hand in 
hand, our hearts big with expectation, — complacently 
confident that by a few smudgy traces in the snow we were 
in a fair way to capture a half-grown specimen of a fabulous 
beast 

We ran the monster across the paddock and along the 
hedge of the next field, and then he took to the road like 
any tame civihzed tax-payer Here his tracks became 
blended with and lost among more ordinary footprints, 
but imagination and a fixed idea will do a great deal, and 
we were sure we knew the direction a dragon would natur- 
ally take. The traces, too, kept reappearing at intervals — 
at least, Charlotte maintained they did, and as it was her 
dragon I left the following of the slot to her and trotted 



126 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

along peacefully, feeling that it was an expedition anyhow 
and something was sure to come out of it. 

Charlotte took me across another field or two, and 
through a copse, and into a fresh road ; and I began to 
feel sure it was only her confounded pride that made her 
go on pretending to see dragon-tracks instead of owning 
she was entirely at fault, like a reasonable person. At last 
she dragged me excitedly through a gap in a hedge of an 
obviously private character ; the waste, open world of 
field and hedgerow disappeared, and we found ourselves 
in a garden, well-kept, secluded, most undragon-haunted 
in appearance. Once inside, I knew where we were. This 
was the garden of my friend the circus-man, though I had 
never approached it before by a lawless gap, from this 
unfamiliar side. And here was the circus-man himself, 
placidly smoking a pipe as he strolled up and down the 
walks. I stepped up to him and asked him politely if he 
had lately seen a Beast. 

“ May I inquire,” he said, with all civility, “ what 
particular sort of a Beast you may happen to be looking 
for ? ” 

“ It’s a lizardy sort of Beast,” I explained. “ Charlotte 
says It’s a dragon, but she doesn’t really know much about 
bc.asts.” 

The ciicus-man looked lound about him slowly. “ I 
don’t think," he said, “ that I’ve seen a dragon in these 
parts recently. But if I come across one I’ll know it 
belongs to you, and I’ll have him taken round to you at 
once.” 

“ Tliank you very much,” said Charlotte, ” but don’t 
trouble about it, please, ’cos p’raps it isn’t a dragon after all. 
Only I thought I saw Ins little footprints in the snow, and 
we followed ’em up, and they seemed to lead right in here, 
but maybe it’s all a mistake, and thank you all the same.” 

“ Oh, no trouble at all,” said the circus-man cheerfully. 
“ I should be only too pleased. But of course, as you say, 
it may be a mistake. And it’s getting dark, and he seems 
to have got away for the present, whatever he is. * You’d 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 127 

better come in and have some tea. I’m quite alone, and 
we’ll make a roaring fire, and I’ve got the biggest Book of 
Beasts you ever saw. It’s got every beast in the world, and 
all of ’em coloured ; and we’ll try and find^yoar beast in it ! ” 

We were always ready for tea at any time, and especially 
when combined with beasts. There was marmalade, too, 
and apricot jam, brought in expressly for us ; and after- 
wards the beast-book was spread out, and, as the man had 
truly said, it contained every sort of beast that had ever 
been in the world. 

The striking of six o’clock set the more prudent Charlotte 
nudging me, and wc recalled oui selves with an effort from 
Beast-land, and reluctantly stood up to go 

“ Here, I’m coming along with you,” said the circus- 
man. “ I want another pipe, and a walk’ll do me good. 
You needn’t talk to me unless you like ” 

Our spirits rose to their wonted level again. The way 
had seemed so long, the outside world so dark and eerie, 
after the bright warm room and the highly-coloured beast- 
book. But a walk with a real Man — why, that was a treat 
in itself ! Wc set off briskly, the Man in the middle. I 
looked up at him and w'ondered whether I should ever live 
to smoke a big pipe with that careless sort of majesty ! 
But Charlotte, whose young mind was not set on tobaceo 
as a possible goal, made herself heard from the other side. 

“ Now, then,” she said, “ tell us a story, please, won’t 
you ^ ” 

The Man sighed heavily and looked about him. “ I knew 
it,” he groaned. “ I knew I should have to tell a story. Oh, 
why did I leave my pleasant fireside ^ Well, I will tell 
you a story. Only let me think a minute.” 

So he thought a minute, and then he told us this story : 

Long ago — might have been hundreds of years ago — 
in a cottage half-way between this village and yonder 
shoulder of the Downs up there, a shepherd lived with his 
wife and their little son. Now the shepherd spent his days 
— and at certain times of the year his nights too— up on 



128 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

the wide ocean-bosom of the Downs, with only the sun 
and the stars and the sheep for company, and the friendly 
chattering world of men and women far out of sight and 
hearing. But his little son, when he wasn’t helping his 
father, and often when he was as well, spent much of his 
time buried in big volumes that he borrowed from the 
affable gentry and interested parsons of the country round 
about. And his parents were very fond of him, and rather 
proud of him too, though they didn’t let on in his hearing, 
so he was left to go his own way and read as much as he 
liked , and instead of frequently getting a cuff on the side 
of the head, as might very well have happened to him, 
he was treated more or less as an equal by his parents, who 
sensibly thought it a very fair division of labour that they 
should supply the practical knowledge, and he the book- 
leaining They knew that book-learning often came in 
useful at a pinch, in spite of what their neighbours said. 
What the Boy chiefly dabbled in was natural history and 
fairy-tales, and he just took them as they came, in a sand* 
vvicliy sort of way, without making any distinctions ; and 
really his course of reading strikes one as rather sensible. 

One evening the shcplieid, who for some nights past had 
been disturbed and preoccupied, and off his usual mental 
balance, came home all of a tremble, and, sitting down at 
the table where his wife and son weie peacefully employed, 
she with her seam, he in follovsing out the adventures of the 
Giant with no Heart in his Body, exclaimed with much 
agitation • 

“ It’s all up with me, Maria ' Never no more can I go 
up on them there Downs, was it ever so ' ” 

“ Now don’t you take on like that,” said his wife, who 
was a very sensible woman : “ but tell us all about it first, 
whatever it is as has given you this shake-up and then me 
and you and the son here, between us, we ought to be able 
to get to the bottom of it ! ” 

“ It began some nights ago,” said the shepherd. “ You 
know that cave up there — I never liked it, somehow, and 
the sheep never liked it neither, and when sheep don’t like 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


tag 

a thing there’s generally some reason for it. Well, for some 
time past there’s been faint noises coming from that cave — 
noises like heavy sighings, with grunts mixed up in them ; 
and sometimes a snoring, far away down — real snoring, 
yet somehow not honest snoring, like you and me o’ nights, 
you know ! ” 

“ I know,” remarked the Boy quietly. 

“ Of course I was terrible frightened,” the shepherd 
went on ,' “ yet somehow 1 couldn’t keep away. So this 
very evening, before I come down, I took a cast round by 
the cave, quietly. And there — O Lord ! there I saw him at 
last, as plain as I see you ! ” 

” Saw who ? ” said his wife, beginning to share in her 
husband’s nervous terror. 

“ Why Aim, I’m a-telling you ! ” said the shepherd. 
” He was sdcking half-way out of the cave, and seemed to 
be enjoying of the cool of the evening in a poetical sort of 
way. He was as big as four cart-horses, and all covered 
with shiny scales — deep-blue scales at the top of him, shad- 
ing off to a tender sort o’ green below. As he breathed, 
there was that sort of flicker over his nostrils that you see 
over our chalk roads on a baking windless day in summer. 
He had his chin on his paws, and I should say he was 
meditating about things. Oh, yes, a peaceable sort o’ 
beast enough, and not ramping or carrying on or doing 
anything but what was quite right and proper. I admit 
all that. And yet, what am I to do ? Scales, you know, and 
claws, and a tail for certain, though I didn’t see that end 
of him — I tiin’t used to ’em, and I don’t hold with ’em, and 
that’s a fact ! ” 

The Boy, who had apparently been absorbed in his book 
during his father’s recital, now closed the volume, yawned, 
clasped his hands behind his head, and said sleepily : 

“ It’s all right, father. Don’t you worry. It’s only a 
dragon.” 

“ Only a dragon ? ” cried his father. “ What do you 
mean, sitting there, you and your dragons ? Only a dragon 
indeed ! And what do you know about it ? ” 

9 



130 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

“ ’Cos it is, and ’cos I do know,” replied the Boy quietly. 
“ Look here, father, you know we’ve each of us got our line. 
You know about sheep, and weather, and things ; I know 
about dragons. I always said, you know, that that cave 
up there was a dragon-cave. I always said it must have 
belonged to a dragon some time, and ought to belong to a 
dragon now, if rules count for anything. Well, now you 
tell me it has got a dragon, and so that's all right. I’m not 
half as much surprised as when you told me it hadn't got a 
dragon. Rules always come right if you wait quietly. 
Now, please, just leave this all to me. And I’ll stroll 
up to-morrow morning — no, in the morning I can’t. I’ve 
got a whole heap of things to do — ^well, perhaps in the 
evening, if I’m quite free. I’ll go up and have a talk to him, 
and you’ll find it’ll be all right. Only please, don’t you go 
worrying round there without me. You don’t understand 
’em a bit, and they’re very sensitive, you know ! ” 

” He’s quite right, father,” said the sensible mother. 
” As he says, dragons is his line and not ours. He’s wonder- 
ful knowing about book-beasts, as every one allows And 
to tell the truth, I’m not half happy in my own mind, think- 
ing of that poor animal lying alone up there, without a bit 
o’ hot supper or anyone to change the news with ; and 
maybe we’ll be able to do something for him ; and if he 
ain’t quite respectable our Boy’ll find it out quick enough. 
He’s got a pleasant sort o’ way with him that makes every- 
body tell him everything ” 

Next day, after he’d had his tea, the Boy strolled up the 
chalky track that led to the summit of the Downs ; and 
there, sure enough, he found the dragon, stretched lazily 
on the sward in front of his cave. The view from that point 
was a magnificent one. To the right and left, the bare and 
billowy leagues of Downs ; in front, the vale, with its 
clustered homesteads, its threads of white roads running 
through orchards and well-tilled acreage, and, far away, 
a hint of grey old cities on the horizon. A cool breeze 
played over the surface of the grass, and the silver shoulder 
of a large moon was showing above distant junipers. No

wonder the dragon seemed in a peaceful and contented 
mood ; indeed, as the Boy approached he could hear the 
beast purring with a happy regularity. “ Well, we live 
and learn ! ” he said to himself. “ None of my books ever 
told me that dragons purred ! ” 

“ Hullo, dragon ! ” said the Boy quietly, when he had 
got up to him. 

The dragon, on hearing the approaching footsteps, made 
the beginning of a courteous effort to rise. But when he saw 
it was a Boy, he set his eyebrows severely. 

“ Now don’t you hit me,” he said ; “ or bung stones, 
or squirt water, or anything. I won’t have it, I tell 
you ! ” 

“ Not goin’ to hit you,” said the Boy wearily, dropping 
on the grass beside the beast : “ and don’t, for goodness’ 
sake, keep on saying ‘ Don’t ’ ; I hear so much of it, and 
it’s monotonous, and makes me tired. I’ve simply looked 
in to ask you how you were and all that sort of thing ; 
but if I’m in the way I can easily clear out. I’ve lots of 
friends, and no one can say I’m in the habit of shoving 
myself in where I’m not wanted ! ” 

“ No, no, don’t go off in a huff,” said the dragon 
hastily ; “ fact is — I’m as happy up here as the day’s 
long ; never without an occupation, dear fellow, never 
without an occupation ! And yet, between ourselves, it 
is a trifle dull at times.” 

The Boy bit off a stalk of grass and chewed it. “ Going 
to make a long stay here ? ” he asked politely. 

“ Can’t hardly say at present,” replied the dragon. 
“ It seems a nice place enough — but I’ve only been here 
a short time, and one must look about and reflect and 
consider before settling down. It’s rather a serious thing, 
settling down. Besides — now I’m going to tell you some- 
thing 1 You’d never guess it if you tried ever so ! — fact is, 
I’m such a confoundedly lazy beggar 1 ” 

“ You surprise me,” said the Boy civilly. 

“ It’s the sad truth,” the dragon went on, settling down 
between his paws and evidently delighted to have found a 



132 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

listener at last : *' and I fancy that’s really how I came to 
be here. You see all the other fellows were so active and 
earnest and all that sort of thing — always rampaging, and 
skirmishing, and scouring the desert sands, and pacing the 
margin of the sea, and chasing knights all over the place, 
and devouring damsels, and going on generally — ^whereas 
I liked to get my meals regular and then to prop my back 
against a bit of rock and snooze a bit, and wake up and 
think of things going on and how they kept going on just 
the same, you know ! So when it happened I got fairly 
caught.” 

“ When what happened, please ? ” asked the Boy. 

“ That’s just what I don’t precisely know,” said the 
dragon. “ I suppose the earth sneezed, or shook itself, 
or the bottom dropped out of something. Anyhow there 
was a shake and a roar and a general stramash, and I 
found myself miles away underground and wedged in as 
tight as tight. Well, thank goodness, my wants arc few, 
and at any rate I had peace and quietness and wasn’t always 
being asked to come along and do something. And I’ve 
got such an active mind — always occupied, I assure you 1 
But time went on, and there was a certain sameness about 
the life, and at last 1 began to think it would be fun to 
work my way upstairs and see what you other fellows were 
doing. So I scratched and burrowed, and worked this way 
and that way and at last I came out through this cave here. 
And I like the country, and the view, and the people — 
what I’ve seen of ’em — and on the whole I feel inclined to 
settle down here.” 

“ What’s your mind always occupied about ? ” asked 
the Boy. “ That’s what I want to know.” 

The dragon coloured slightly and looked away. Presently 
he said bashfully : 

“ Did you ever— just for fun — try to make up poetry — 
verses, you know ? ” 

“ ’Course I have,” said the Boy. “ Heaps of it. And 
some of it’s quite good, I feel sure, only there’s no one here 
cares about it. Mother’s very kind and all that, when I 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


133 

read it to her, and so’s father for that matter. But somehow 
they don’t seem to ” 

" Exactly,” cried the dragon ; “ my own case exactly. 
They don’t seem to, and you can’t argue with ’em about it. 
Now you’ve got culture, you have, I could tell it on you at 
once, and I should just like your candid opinion about some 
little things I threw off lighdy, when I was down there. I’m 
awfully pleased to have met you, and I’m hoping the other 
neighbours will be equally agreeable There was a very 
nice old gentleman up here only last night, but he didn’t 
seem to want to intrude. 

“ That was my father,” said the Boy, “ and he is a nice 
old gentleman, and I’ll introduce you some day if you like.” 

“ Can’t you two come up here and dine or something 
to-morrow ? ” asked the dragon eagerly. “ Only, of course, 
if you’ve got nothing better to do,” he added politely. 

“ Thanks awfully,” said the Boy, “ but we don’t go out 
anywhere without my mother, and, to tell you the truth, 
I’m afraid she mightn’t quite approve of you. You see 
there’s no getting over the hard fact that you’re a dragon, 
is there ? And when you talk of settling down, and the 
neighbours, and so on, I can’t help feeling that you don’t 
quite realize your position. You’re an enemy of the 
human race, you see ! ” 

“ Haven’t got an enemy in the world,” said the dragon 
cheerfully. “ Too lazy to make ’em, to begin with. And 
if I do read other fellows my poetry. I’m always ready to 
listen to theirs ! ” 

“ Oh, dear ! ” cried the Boy, “ I wish you’d try and grasp 
the situation properly. When the other people find you out, 
they’ll come after you with spears and swords and all sorts 
of things. You’ll have to be exterminated, according to 
their way of looking at it ! You’re a scourge, and a pest, 
and a baneful monster ! ” 

” Not a word of truth in it,” said the dragon, wagging 
his head solemnly. ‘'Character'll bear the strictest investiga- 
tion. And now, there’s a little sonnet-thing I was working 
on when you appeared on the scene ” 



134 the reluctant DRAGON 

“ Oh, if you won't be sensible,” cried the Boy, getting up, 
“ I’m going off home. No, I can’t stop for sonnets ; my 
mother’s sitting up. I’ll look you up to-morrow, some time 
or other, and do for goodness’ sake try and realize that 
you’re a pestilential scourge, or you’ll find yourself in a 
most awful fix. Good night ! ” 

The Boy found it an easy matter to set the mind of his 
parents at ease about his new friend. They had always left 
that branch to him, and they took his word without a 
murmur. The shepherd was formally introduced and 
many compliments and kind inquiries were exchanged. 
His wife, however, though expressing her willingness to 
do anything she could — to mend things, or set the cave to 
rights, or cook a little something when the dragon had been 
poring over sonnets and forgotten his meals, as male things 
mil do, could not be brought to recognize him formally. 
The fact that he was a dragon and “ they didn’t know who 
he was ” seemed to count for everything with her. She 
made no objection, however, to her little son spending his 
evenings with the dragon quietly, so long as he was home 
by nine o’clock : and many a pleasant night they had, sit- 
ting on the sward, while the dragon told stories of old, old 
times, when dragons were quite plentiful and the world 
was a livelier place than it is now, and life was full of 
thrills and jumps and surprises. 

What the Boy had feared, however, soon came to pass. 
The most modest and retiring dragon in the world, if he’s 
as big as four cart-horses and covered with blue scales, 
cannot keep altogether out of the public view. And so in 
the village tavern of nights the fact that a real live dragon 
sat brooding in the cave on the Downs was naturally a 
subject for talk. Though the villagers were extremely 
frightened, they were rather proud as well. It was a dis- 
tinction to have a dragon of your own, and it was felt to be a 
feather in the cap of the village. Still, all were agreed 
this sort of thing couldn’t be allowed to go on. The dread- 
ful beast must be exterminated, the country-side must be 
freed from this pest, this terror, this destroying scourge. 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


135 

The fact that not even a hen*roost was the worse for the 
dragon’s arrival wasn’t allowed to have anything to do with 
It. He was a dragon, and he couldn’t deny it, and if he 
didn’t choose to behave as such that was his own look-out. 
But in spite of much valiant talk no hero was found willing 
to take sword and spear and free the suffering village and 
win deathless fame ; and each night’s heated discussion 
always ended in nothing. Meanwhile the dragon, a happy 
Bohemian, lolled on the turf, enjoyed the sunsets, told ante- 
diluvian anecdotes to the Boy, and polished his old verses 
while meditating on fresh ones. 

One day the Boy, on walking into the village, found 
everything wearing a festal appearance which was not 
to be accounted for in the calendar. Carpets and gay- 
coloured stuffs were hung out of the windows, the church- 
bells clamoured noisily, the little street was flower-strewn 
and the whole population jostled each other along either 
side of it, chattering, shoving, and ordering each other to 
stand back. The Boy saw a friend of his own age in the 
crowd and hailed him. 

“ What’s up ? ” he cried. " Is it the players, or bears, 
or a circus, or what ? ” 

“ It’s all right,” his friend hailed back. “ He’s a- 
coming.” 

“ Who's a-coming ? ” demanded the Boy, thrusting into 
the throng. 

“ Why, St. George, of course,” replied his friend. “ He’s 
heard tell of our dragon, and he’s cornin’ on purpose to slay 
the deadly beast, and free us from his horrid yoke. O my 1 
won’t there be a jolly fight ! ” 

Here was news indeed ! The Boy felt that he ought to 
make quite sure for himself, and he wriggled himself in 
between the legs of his good-natured elders, abusing them 
all the time for their unmannerly habit of shoving. Once 
in the front rank, he breathlessly awaited the arrival. 

Presently from the far-away end of the line came the 
sound of cheering. Next, the measured tramp of a great 
war-horse made his heart beat quicker, and then he found 



136 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

himself cheering with the rest, as, amidst welcoming shouts, 
shrill cries of women, uplifting of babies, and waving of 
handkerchiefs, St. George paced slowly up the street. The 
Boy’s heart stood still and he breathed with sobs, the beauty 
and the grace of the hero were so far beyond anything he 
had yet seen. His fluted armour was inlaid with gold, his 
plumed helmet hung at his saddle-bow, and his thick fair 
hair framed a face gracious and gentle beyond expression 
till you caught the sternness in his eyes. He drew rein in 
front of the little inn, and the villagers crowded round with 
greetings and thanks and voluble statements of their wrongs 
and grievances and oppressions. The Boy heard the grave 
gentle voice of the Saint, assuring them that all would be 
well now, and that he would stand by them and see them 
righted and free them from their foe ; then he dismounted 
and passed through the doorway and the crowd poured in 
after him. But the Boy made off up the hill as fast as he 
could lay his legs to the ground. 

“ It’s all up, dragon ! ” he shouted as soon as he was 
within sight of the beast “ He’s coming ! He’s here now ! 
You’ll have to pull yourself together and do something at 
last ! ” 

The dragon was licking his scales and rubbing them with 
a bit of house-flannel the Boy’s mother had lent him, till 
he shone like a great turquoise. 

“ Don’t be violent, Boy,” he said without looking round. 
“ Sit down and get your breath, and try and remember 
that the noun governs the verb, and then perhaps you’ll be 
good enough to tell me who’s coming ? ” 

“ That’s right, take it coolly,” said the Boy. “ Hope 
you’ll be half as cool when I’ve got through with my news. 
It’s only St. George who’s coming, that’s all ; he rode into 
the village half an hour ago. Of course you can lick him — 
a great big fellow like you ! But I thought I’d warn you, 
’cos he’s sure to be round early, and he’s got the longest, 
wickedest-looking spear you ever did see ! ” And the Boy 
*got up and began to jump round in sheer delight at the 
prospect of the battle. 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 137 

" O deary, deary me,” moaned the dragon ; “ this is 
too awful. I won’t see him, and that’s flat. I don’t want 
to know the fellow at all. I’m sure he’s not nice. You must 
tell him to go away at once, please. Say he can write if he 
likes, but I can’t give him an interview. I’m not seeing any- 
body at present.” 

“ Now, dragon, dragon,” said the Boy imploringly, 
“ don’t be perverse and wrong-headed. You’ve got 
to fight him some time or other, you know, ’cos he’s St. 
George and you’re the dragon. Better get it over, and then 
we can go on with the sonnets. And you ought to consider 
other people a little, too. If it’s been dull up here for you, 
think how dull it’s been for me ! ” 

“ My dear little man,” said the dragon solemnly, “ just 
understand, once for all, that I can’t tight and I won’t tight. 
I’ve never fought in my life, and I’m not going to begin 
now, just to give you a Roman holiday. In old days I 
always let the other fellows — the earnest fellows — do all the 
fighting, and no doubt that’s why I have the pleasure of 
being here now.” 

“ But if you don’t fight he’ll cut your head off ! ” gasped 
the Boy, miserable at the prospect of losing both his fight 
and his friend. 

“ Oh, I think not,” said the dragon in his lazy way. 
” You’ll be able to arrange something. I’ve every con- 
fidence in you, you’re such a manager. Just run down, 
there’s a dear chap, and make it all right. I leave it entirely 
to you.” 

The Boy made his way back to the village in a state of 
great despondency. First of all, there wasn’t going to be 
any fight ; next, his dear and honoured friend the dragon 
hadn’t shown up in quite such a heroic light as he would 
have liked ; and lastly, whether the dragon was a hero at 
heart or not, it made no difference, for St. George would 
most undoubtedly cut his head off. “ Arrange things 
indeed ! ” he said bitterly to himself. ” The dragon treats 
the whole affair as if it was an invitation to tea and croquet.” 

The villagers were straggling homewards as he passed 



138 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

up the street, all of them in the highest spirits, and gleefully 
discussing the splendid fight that was in store. The 
Boy pursued his way to the inn, and passed into the principal 
chamber, where St. George now sat alone, musing over the 
chances of the fight, and the sad stories of rapine and of 
wrong that had so lately been poured into his sympathetic 
ears. 

“ May I came in, St. George ? ” said the Boy politely, 
as he paused at the door. “ I want to talk to you about this 
little matter of the dragon, if you’re not tired of it by this 
time.” 

“ Yes, come in. Boy,” said the Saint kindly. “ Another 
tale of misery and wrong, I fear me. Is it a kind parent, 
then, of whom the tyrant has bereft you ? Or some tender 
sister or brother ? Well, it shall soon be avenged.” 

“ Nothing of the sort,” said the Boy. “ There’s a mis- 
understanding somewhere, and I want to put it right. The 
fact IS, this is a good dragon.” 

“ Exactly,” said St. George, smiling pleasantly, “ I 
quite understand. A good dragon. Believe me, I do not 
in the least regret that he is an adversary worthy of my steel, 
and no feeble speamen of his noxious tribe.” 

“ But he’s not a noxious tribe,” cried the Boy distressedly. 
“ Oh dear, oh dear, how stupid men are when they get 
an idea into their heads ! I tell you he’s a good dragon, and 
a friend of mine, and tells me the most beautiful stories 
you ever heard, all about old times and when he was little. 
And he’s been so kind to mother, and mother’d do anything 
for him. And father likes him too, though father doesn’t 
hold with art and poetry much, and always falls asleep 
when the dragon starts talking about style. But the fact is, 
nobody can help liking him when once they know him. He’s 
so engaging and so trustful, and as simple as a child ! ” 

“ Sit down, and draw your chair up,” said St. George. 
*' I like a fellow who sticks up for his friends, and I’m sure 
the dragon has his good points, if he’s got a friend like you. 
But that’s not the question. All this evening I’ve been 
listening, with grief and anguish unspeakable, to tales of 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


139 

murder, theft, and wrong ; rather too highly coloured, 
perhaps, not always quite convincing, but forming in the 
main a most serious roll of crime. History teaches us that 
the greatest rascals often possess all the domestic virtues ; 
and I fear that your cultivated friend, in spite of the qualities 
which have won (and rightly) your regard, has got to be 
speedily exterminated.” 

“ Oh, you’ve been taking in all the yarns those fellows 
have been telling you,” said the Boy impatiently. “ Why, 
our villagers are the biggest story-tellers in all the country 
round. It’s a known fact. You’re a stranger in these parts, 
or else you’d have heard it already. All they want is a fight. 
They’re the most awful beggars for getting up fights — 
It’s meat and drink to them Dogs, bulls, dragons — ^any- 
thing so long as it’s a fight. Why, they’ve got a poor inno- 
cent badger in the stable behind here, at this moment. 
They were going to have some fun with him to-day, but 
they’re saving him up now till your little affair’s over. And 
I’ve no doubt they’ve been telhng you what a hero you were, 
and how you were bound to win, in the cause of right and 
justice, and so on ; but let me tell you, I came down the 
street just now, and they were betting six to four on the 
dragon freely ' ” 

“ Six to four on the dragon ! ” murmured St. George 
sadly, resting his cheek on his hand. “ This is an evil 
world, and sometimes I begin to think that all the wicked- 
ness in it is not entirely bottled up inside the dragons. And 
yet — may not this wily beast have misled you as to his real 
character, in order that your good report of him may serve 
as a cloak for his evil deeds ■’ Nay, may there not be, at 
this very moment, some hapless Princess immured within 
yonder gloomy cavern ? ” 

The moment he had spoken, St. George was sorry for 
what he had said, the Boy looked so genuinely distressed. 

“ I assure you, St. George,” he said earnestly, “ there’s 
nothing of the sort in the cave at all. The dragon’s a real 
gentleman, every inch of him, and I may say that no one 
would be more shocked and grieved than he would, at 



140 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

hearing you talk in that — ^that loose way about matters on 
which he has very strong views ! ” 

“ Well, perhaps I’ve been over-credulous,” said St. 
George. “ Perhaps I’ve misjudged the animal. But what 
are we to do ? Here are the dragon and I, almost face to 
face, each supposed to be thirsting for each other’s blood. 
I don’t see any way out of it, exactly. What do you sug- 
gest ? Can’t you arrange things, somehow ? ” 

" That’s just what the dragon said," replied the Boy, 
rather nettled. “ Really, the way you two seem to leave 
everything to me — I suppose you couldn’t be persuaded 
to go away quietly, could you ? ” 

” Impossible, I fear,” said the Saint “ Quite against 
the rules. You know that as well as I do.” 

“ Well, then, look here,” said the Boy, “ it’s early yet — 
would you mind strolling up with me and seeing the dragon 
and talking it over ? It’s not far, and any friend of mine 
will be most welcome.” 

“ Well, it’s irregular," said St. George, rising, “ but really 
it seems about the most sensible thing to do. You’re taking 
a lot of trouble on your friend’s account,” he added good- 
naturedly, as they passed out through the door together. 
" But cheer up ! Perhaps there won’t have to be any fight 
after all.” 

“ Oh, but I hope there will, though ! ” replied the little 
fellow wistfully. 

“ I’ve brought a friend to see you, dragon,” said the 
Boy rather loud. 

Tlie dragon woke up with a start. “ I was just — er — 
thinking about things,” he said in his simple way. ” Very 
pleased to make your acquaintance, sir. Charming weather 
we’re having ! ” 

“ This is St. George,” said the Boy, shordy. “ St. George, 
let me introduce you to the dragon. We’ve come up to 
talk things over quiedy, dragon, and now for goodness’ 
sake do let us have a little straight common sense, and come 
to some pracdcal business-like arrangement, for I’m sick 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 141 

of views and theories of life and personal tendencies, and 
all that sort of thing. I may perhaps add that my mother’s 
sitting up.” 

“ So glad to meet you, St. George,” began the dragon 
rather nervously, “ because you’ve been a great traveller, 
I hear, and I’ve always been rather a stay-at-home. But 
I can show you many antiquities, many interesting featiues 
of our country-side, if you’re stopping here any time ” 

” I think,” said St. George in his frank, pleasant way, 
“ that we’d really better take the advice of our young 
friend here, and try to come to some understanding, on a 
business footing, alraut this little affair of ours. Now don’t 
you think that after all the simplest plan would be just to 
fight it out, according to the rules, and let the best man 
win ? They’re betting on you, I may tell you, down in 
the village, but 1 don’t mind that ! ” 

“ Oh, yes, do, dragon,” said the Boy delightedly ; ” it’ll 
save such a lot of bother ! ” 

” My young friend, you shut up,” said the dragon 
severely. “ Believe me, St George,” he went on, “ there’s 
nobody in the world I’d sooner oblige than you and this 
young gentleman here. But the whole thing’s nonsense, 
and conventionality, and popular thick-headedness. 
There’s absolutely nothing to fight about, from beginning 
to end. And anyhow I’m not going to, so that settles it ! ” 

“ But supposing I make you ? ” said St. George, rather 
nettled. 

” You can’t,” said the dragon triumphantly. “ I should 
only go into my cave and reure for a time down the hole 
I came up. You’d soon get heartily sick of sitting outside 
and waiting for me to come out and fight you. And as 
soon as you’d really gone away, why, I’d come up again 
gaily, for I tell you frankly, I like this place, and I’m going 
to stay here ! ” 

St. George gazed for a while on the fair landscape around 
them. “ But this would be a beautiful place for a fight,” 
he began again persuasively. ” These great bare rolling 
Downs for the arena — and me in my golden armour 



142 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

showdng up ag»nst your big blue scaly coils ! Think what 
a picture it would make ! ” 

“ Now you’re trying to get at me through my artistic 
sensibilities,” said the dragon. “ But it won’t work. Not 
but what it would make a very pretty picture, as you say,” 
he added, wavering a little. 

“ We seem to be getting rather nearer to business'* put in 
the Boy. “ You must see, dragon, that there’s got to be 
a fight of some sort, ’cos you can’t want to have to go down 
that dirty old hole again and stop there till goodness knows 
when.” 

“ It might be arranged,” said St. George thoughtfully. 
” I must spear you somewhere, of course, but I’m not bound 
to hurt you very much. There’s such a lot of you that there 
must be a few spare places somewhere. Here, for instance, 
just behind your foreleg. It couldn’t hurt you much, just 
here ! ” 

” Now you’re tickling, George,” said the dragon coyly. 
“ No, that place won’t do at all Even if it didn’t hurt — 
and I’m sure it would, awfully — ^it would make me laugh, 
and that would spoil everything ” 

“ Let’s try somewhere else, then,” said St. George 
patiently “ Under your neck, for instance — all these 
folds of thick skin, — if I speared you here you’d never even 
know I’d done it ! ” 

“ Yes, but are you sure you can hit off the right place ? ” 
asked the dragon anxiously. 

“ Of course I am,” said St. George, with confidence. 
“ You leave that to me ! ” 

“ It’s just because I’ve got to leave it to you that I’m 
asking,” replied the dragon rather testily. “ No doubt you 
would deeply regret any error you might make in the hurry 
of the moment ; but you wouldn’t regret it half as much 
as I should ! However, I suppose we’ve got to trust some- 
body, as we go through hfe, and your plan seems, on the 
whole, as good a one as any.” 

” Look here, dragon,” interrupted the Boy, a little jealous 
on behalf of his friend, who seemed to be getting all the 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


H3 

worst of the bargain : “ I don’t quite see where you come 
in ! There’s to be a fight, apparently, and you’re to be 
licked ; and what I want to know is, what aseyou going to 
get out of it ? ” 

“ St. George,” said the dragon, “just tell him, please — 
what will happen after I’m vanquished in the deadly 
combat ? ” 

“ Well, according to the rules I suppose I shall lead you 
in triumph down to the market-place or whatever answers 
to it,” said St. George. 

“ Precisely,” said the dragon “ And then ? ” 

“ And then there’ll be shoutings and speeches and 
things,” continued St. George “ And I shall explain that 
you’re converted, and see the error of your ways, and so 
on.” 

“ Quite so,” said the dragon. “ And then ” 

“ Oh, and then ” said St. George, “ why, and then 

there will be the usual banquet, I suppose.” 

“ Exactly,” said the dragon ; “ and that’s where / 
come in. Look here,” he continued, addressing the Boy, 
“ I’m bored to death up here, and no one really appreciates 
me. I’m going into Society, I am, through the kindly 
aid of our friend here, who’s taking such a lot of trouble 
on my account ; and you’ll find I’ve got all the qualities 
to endear me to people who entertain ! So now that’s all 
settled, and if you don’t mind — I’m an old-fashioned fellow 
— don’t want to turn you out, but ” 

“ Remember, you’ll have to do your proper share of the 
fighting, dragon ! ” stiid St. George, as he took the hint 
and rose to go ; “I mean ramping, and breathing fire, 
and so on I ” 

“ I can ran^ all tight,” replied the dragon confidently ; 
“ as to breathing fire, it’s surprising how easily one gets 
out of practice ; but I’ll do the best I can. Good 
night ! ” 

They had descended the hill and were almost back in the 
village again, when St. George stopped short. “ Anew 
I had forgotten something,” he said. “ There ought to be 



144 the reluctant DRAGON 

a Princess. Terror-stricken and chained to a rock, and all 
that sort of thing Boy, can’t you arrange a Princess ? ” 

The Boy was in the middle of a tremendous yawn. 
“ I’m tired to death,” he wailed, “ and I can't arrange a 
Princess, or anything more, at this time of night. And my 
mother’s sitting up, and do stop asking me to arrange more 
things till to-morrow ! ” 

Next morning the people began streaming up to the 
Downs at qmte an early hour, in their Sunday clothes and 
carrying baskets with bottle-necks sticking out of them, 
every one intent on securing good places for the combat. 
This was not exactly a simple matter, for of course it was 
quite possible that the dragon might win, and in that 
case even those who had put their money on him felt they 
could hardly expect him to deal with his backers on a 
different fooung to the rest. Places were chosen, therefore, 
with circumspection and with a view to a speedy retreat 
in case of emergency ; and the front rank was mostly com- 
posed of boys who had escaped from parental control and 
now sprawled and rolled about on the grass, regardless of 
the shrill threats and warnings discharged at them by 
their anxious mothers behind. 

The Boy had secured a good front place, well up towards 
the cave, and was feeling as anxious as a stage-manager 
on a first night. Could the dragon be depended upion ? 
He might change his mind and vote the whole performance 
rot ; or else, seeing that the affair had been so hastily 
planned, without even a rehearsal, he might be too nervous 
to show up. The Boy looked narrowly at the cave, but it 
showed no sign of life or occupation. Could the dragon 
have made a moonlight flitting ^ 

The higher portions of the ground were now black with 
sightseers, and presently a sound of cheering and a waving 
of handkerchiefs told that something was visible to them 
which the Boy, far up towards the dragon-end of the line 
as he was, could not yet see. A minute more and St. 
George’s red plumes topped the hill, as the Saint rode 
slowly forth on the great level space which stretched up to 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 145 

the grim mouth of the cave. Very gallant and beautiful 
he looked on his tall war-horse, his golden armour glancing 
in the sun, his great spear held erect, the little white pennon, 
crimson-crossed, fluttering at its point. He drew rein and 
remained motionless. The lines of spectators began to give 
back a little, nervously ; and even the boys in front stopped 
pulling hair and cuffing each other, and leaned forward 
expectant. 

“ Now then, dragon ! ’* muttered the Boy impatiently, 
fidgeting where he sat. He need not have distressed him- 
self, had he only known. The dramatic possibilities of the 
thing had tickled the dragon immensely, and he had been 
up from an early hour, preparing for his first public appear- 
ance with as much heartiness as if the years had run 
backwards, and he had been again a little dragonlet, play- 
ing with his sisters on the floor of their mother’s cave, at 
the game of saints-and-dragons, in which the dragon was 
bound to win. 

A low muttering, mingled with snorts, now made itself 
heard ; rising to a bellowing roar that seemed to fill the 
plain. Then a cloud of smoke obscured the mouth of the 
cave, and out of the midst of it the dragon himself, shining, 
sea-blue, magnificent, pranced splendidly forth ; and every- 
body said, “ Oo-oo-oo ! ” as if he had been a mighty 
rocket ! His scales were glittering, his long spiky tail lashed 
his sides, his claws tore up the turf and sent it flying high 
over his back, and smoke and fire incessantly jetted from 
his angry nostrils. “ Oh, well done, dragon ! ” cried the 
Boy excitedly. Didn’t think he had it in him 1 ” he 
added to himself. 

St. George lowered his spear, bent his head, dug his 
heels into his horse’s sides, and came thundering over the 
turf. The dragon charged with a roar and a squeal, — a 
great blue whirling combination of coils and snorts and 
clashing jaws and spikes and fire. 

“ Missed ! ” yelled the crowd. There was a moment’s 
entanglement of g^olden armour and blue-green coib and 
spiky tail, and then the great horse, tearing at his bit, 

10 



146 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

carried the Saint, his spear swung high in the air, almost 
up to the mouth of the cave. 

The dragon sat down and barked viciously, while St. 
George with difficulty pulled his horse round into position. 

“ End of Round One ! *’ thought the Boy. “ How 
well they managed it 1 But I hope the Saint won’t get 
excited. I can trust the dragon all right. What a regular 
play-actor the fellow is 1 ” 

St. George had at last prevailed on his horse to stand 
steady and was looking round him as he wiped his brow. 
Catching sight of the Boy, he smiled and nodded, and held 
up three fingers for an instant. 

“ It seems to be all planned out,” said the Boy to himself. 
“ Round Three is to be the finishing one, evidently. Wish 
it could have lasted a bit longer. Whatever’s that old fool 
of a dragon up to now ? ” 

The dragon was employing the interval in giving a 
ramping performance for the benefit of the crowd. Ramp- 
ing, it should be explained, consists in running round and 
round in a wide circle, and sending waves and ripples of 
movement along the whole length of your spine, from your 
pointed ears right down to the spike at the end of your long 
tail. When you are covered with blue scedes, the effect is 
particularly pleasing ; and the Boy recollected the dragon’s 
recently expressed wish to become a social success. 

St. George now gathered up his reins and began to move 
forward, dropping the point of his spear and settling him- 
self firmly in the saddle. 

“ Time ! ” yelled everybody excitedly ; and the dragon, 
leaving off his ramping, sat up on end, and began to leap 
from one side to the other with huge ungainly bounds, 
whooping like a Red Indian. This naturally disconcerted 
the horse, who swerved violently, the Saint only just saving 
himself by the mane ; and as they shot past the dragon 
delivered a vicious snap at the horse’s tail which sent the 
poor beast careering madly far over the Downs, so that the 
language of the Saint, who had lost a stirrup, was fortu- 
nately inaudible to the general assemblage. 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


147 

Round Two evoked audible evidence of friendly feeling 
towards the dragon. The spectators were not slow to 
appreciate a combatant who could hold his own so well and 
clearly wanted to show good sport ; and many encouraging 
remarks reached the ears of oiu: friend as he strutted to 
and fro, his chest thrust out and his tail in the air, hugely 
enjoying his new popularity. 

St. George had dismounted and was tightening his girths, 
and telling his horse, with quite an Oriental flow of imagery, 
exactly what he thought of him, and his relations, and his 
conduct on the present occasion ; so the Boy made his way 
down to the Saint’s end of the line, and held his spear for 
him. 

“ It’s been a jolly fight, St. George 1 ” he said, with a 
sigh. “ Can’t you let it last a bit longer ” 

“ Well, I think I’d better not,” replied the Saint. 
“ The fact is, your simple-minded old friend’s getting 
conceited, now they’ve begun cheering him, and he’ll 
forget all about the arrangement and take to playing the 
fool, and there’s no telling where he would stop. I’ll just 
finish him off this round.” 

He swung himself into the saddle and took his spear from 
the Boy. “ Now don’t you be afraid,” he added kindly. 
“I’ve marked my spot exactly, and Ae’s sure to give me 
all the assistance in his power, because he knows it’s his 
only chance of being asked to the banquet ! ” 

St. George now shortened his spear, bringing the butt 
well up under his arm ; and, instead of galloping as 
before, trotted smartly towards the dragon, who crouched 
at his approach, flicking his tail till it cracked in the air 
like a great cart-whip The Saint wheeled as he neared 
his opponent and circled warily round him, keeping his 
eye on the spare place ; while the dragon, adopting similar 
tactics, paced with caution round the same circle, occasion- 
ally feinting with his head. So the two sparred for an open- 
ing, while the spectators maintained a breathless silence. 

Though the round lasted for some minutes, the end 
was so swift that all the Boy saw was a lightning movement 



148 THE RELUC3TANT DRAGON 

of the Saint’s arm, and then a whirl and a confusion of 
spines, claws, tail, and flying bits of turf. The dust cleared 
away, the spectators whooped and ran in cheering, and the 
Boy made out that the dragon was down, pinned to the 
earth by the spear, while St. George had dismounted, and 
stood astride of him. 

It all seemed so genuine that the Boy ran in breathlessly, 
hoping the dear old dragon wasn’t really hurt. As he 
approached, the dragon lifted one large eyelid, winked 
solemnly, and collapsed again. He was held fast to earth 
by the neck, but the Saint had hit him in the spare place 
agreed upon, and it didn’t even seem to tickle. 

“ Bain’t you goin’ to cut ’is ’ed orf, master ? ” asked one 
of the applauding crowd. He had backed the dragon, 
and naturally felt a trifle sore. 

“ Well, not to-day, I think,” replied St. George pleasantly. 
** You see, that can be done at any time. There’s no hurry 
at all. I think we’ll all go down to the village first, and have 
some refreshment, and then I’ll give him a good talking&gt;to, 
and you’ll find he’ll be a very different dragon ! ” 

At that magic word refreshment the whole crowd formed 
up in procession and silently awaited the signal to start. 
The time for talking and cheering and betting was past, 
the hour for action had arrived. St. George, hauling on 
his spear with both hands, released the dragon, who rose 
and shook himself and ran his eye over his spikes and scales 
and things, to see that they were all in order. Then the 
Saint mounted and led off the procession, the dragon 
following meekly in the company of the Boy, while the 
thirsty spectators kept at a respectful interval behind. 

There were great doings when they got down to the 
village again, and had formed up in front of the inn. 
After refreshment St. George made a speech, in which he 
informed his audience that he had removed their direful 
scourge, at a great deal of trouble and inconvenience to 
himself, and now they weren’t to go about grumbling and 
fancying they’d got grievances, because they hadn’t. And 
they shouldn’t be so fond of fights, because next time they 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


149 

might have to do the fighting themselves, which would not 
be the same thing at all. And there was a certain badger 
in the inn stables which had got to be released at once, 
and he’d come and see it done himself. Then he told them 
that the dragon had been thinking over things, and saw 
that there were two sides to every question, and he wasn’t 
going to do it any more, and if they were good perhaps he’d 
stay and settle down there. So they must make friends, 
and not be prejudiced, and go about fancying they knew 
everything there was to be known, because they didn’t, 
not by a long way. And he warned them against the sin of 
romancing, and making up stories and fancying other 
people would believe them just because they were plausible 
and highly&gt;coloured. Then he sat down, amidst much 
repentant cheering, and the dragon nudged the Boy in the 
ribs and whispered that he couldn’t have done it better 
himself. Then every one went off to get ready for the 
banquet. 

Banquets are always pleasant things, consisting mostly, 
as they do, of eating and drinking ; but the specially nice 
thing about a banquet is, that it comes when something’s 
over, and there’s nothing more to worry about, and to- 
morrow seems a long way off. St. George was happy 
because there had been a fight and he hadn’t had to kill 
anybody ; for he didn’t reaUy like killing, though he 
generally had to do it. The dragon was happy because 
there had been a fight, and so far from being hurt in it 
he had won popularity and a sure fooUng in society. 
The Boy was happy because there had been a fight, and in 
spite of it all his two fiiends were on the best of terms. And 
^1 the others were happy because there had been a fight, 
and — ^well, they didn’t require any other reasons for their 
happiness. The dragon exerted himself to say the right 
thing to everybody, and proved the life and soul of the 
evening ; while the Saint and the Boy, as they looked on, 
felt that they were only assisting at a feast of which the 
honour and the glory were entirely the dragon’s. But they 
didn’t mind that, being good fellows, and the dragon was 



150 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

not in the least proud or forgetful. On the contrary, every 
ten minutes or so he leant over towards the Boy and said 
impressively : “ Look here ! you mil see me home after- 
wards, won’t you ? ” And the Boy always nodded, though 
he had promised his mother not to be out late. 

At last the banquet was over, the guests had dropped 
away with many good nights and congratulations and 
invitations, and the dragon, who had seen the last of them 
off the premises, emerged into the street followed by the 
Boy, wiped his brow, sighed, sat down in the road and 
gazed at the stars. “Jolly night it’s been ! ’’ he murmured. 
“ Jolly stars ! Jolly little place this ! Think I shall just 
stop here. Don’t feel like climbing up any beastly hill. 
Boy’s promised to see me home Boy had better do it then ! 
No responsibility on my part. Responsibility all Boy’s ! ’’ 
And his chin sank on his broad chest and he slumbered 
peacefully. 

“ Oh, get up, dragon,” cried the Boy piteously. “ You 
know my mother’s sitting up, and I’m so tired, and you 
made me promise to see you home, and I never knew what 
it meant or I wouldn’t have done it ! ” And the Boy sat 
down in the road by the side of the sleeping dragon, and 
cried. 

The door behind them opened, a stream of light Ulumined 
the road, and St. George, who had come out for a stroll 
in the cool night-air, caught sight of the two figures sitting 
there — the great motionless dragon and the tearful little 
Boy. 

“ What’s the matter. Boy ? ” he inquired kindly, stepping 
to his side. 

“ Oh, it’s this great lumbering pig of a dragon ! ” 
sobbed the Boy. “ First he makes me promise to see him 
home, and then he says I’d better do it, and goes to sleep ! 
Might as well try to see a haystack home ! And I’m so 
tired, and mother’s ” Here he broke down again. 

“ Now don’t take on,” said St. George. “ I’ll stand by 
you, and we’ll both see him home. Wake up, dragon I ” 
he said sharply, shaking the beast by the elbow. 



THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 


&gt;51 

The dragon looked up sleepily. “ What a night, 
George ! ” he murmured ; “ what a ” 

“ Now look here, dragon,” said the Saint firmly. “ Here’s 
this little fellow waiting to sec you home, and you know 
he ought to have been in bed these two hours, and what his 
mother’ll say I don’t know, and anbody but a selfish pig 
would have made him go to bed long ago ” 

“ And he shall go to bed ! ” cried the dragon, starting up. 
” Poor little chap, only fancy his being up at this hour ! 
It’s a shame, that’s what it is, and I don’t think, St. George, 
you’ve been very considerate — but come along at once, 
and don’t let us have any more arguing or shilly-shallying. 
You give me hold of your hand. Boy — thank you, George, 
an arm up the hill is just what I wanted ! ” 

So they set off up the hill arm-in-arm, the Saint, the 
Dragon, and the Boy. The hghts in the little village began 
to go out ; but there were stars, and a late moon, as they 
climbed to the Downs together. And, as they turned the 
last corner and disappeared from view, snatches of an old 
song were borne back on the night-breeze. I can’t be 
certain which of them was singing, but I think it was the 
Dragon 1 

“ Here we arc at your gate,” said the man abruptly, 
laying his hand on it. “ Good night. Cut along in sharp, 
or you’ll catch it ! ” 

Gould it really be our own gate ? Yes, there it was, 
sure enough, with the familiar marks on its bottom bar 
made by our feet when we swung on it. 

“ Oh, but wait a minute ! ” cried Charlotte. “ I want 
to know a heap of things. Did the dragon really setde 
down ? And did ” 

“ There isn’t any more of that story,” said the man, 
kindly but firmly. “ At least, not to-night. Now be off ! 
Good-bye ! ” 

“ Wonder if it’s all true ? ” said Charlotte, as we hurried 
up the path. “ Sounded dreadfully like nonsense, in 
parts 1 ” 



153 THE RELUCTANT DRAGON 

“ P*'raps it's true for all that,” I replied encouragingly. 

Charlotte bolted in like a rabbit, out of the cold and the 
dark ; but I lingered a moment in the still, frosty air, for a 
backward glance at the silent white world without, ere 
I changed it for the land of firelight and cushions and 
laughter. It was the day for choir-practice, and carol- 
time was at hand, and a belated member was passing home- 
wards down the road, sin^ng as he went : 

" Then St George ee made rev’rence in the stable so dim, 

Oo vanquished the dragon so fearful and grim 
So-ognm and so-o fierce that now may we say 
All peaceful is our wahin' . on Chn-istmas Day / " 

The singer receded, the carol died away. But I won- 
dered, with my hand on the door-latch, whether that was 
the song, or something like it, that the dragon sang as he 
toddled contentedly up the hill.
